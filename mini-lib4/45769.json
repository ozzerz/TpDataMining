    "After working with the 2.1 RC for a week or so, I decided to take a look at the 3.0 M4 build as 2.1 \nonly runs on JVM 1.3.1 (all my hacks to run it on 1.4.1 failed) and I need JDK 1.4 features in Ant.\n\nI created an empty Java project, then using the CVS Repository browser, checked out four CVS \nmodules into subdirectories, set the source folders and added an number of external jars in the \nproject properties as well as a couple of plain folders. All this I have done in 2.1 without problems.\nI then closed Eclipse and symlinked from one subdir to another (we have a servlets CVS module \nand a jsp CVS module and we symlink WEB-INF/classes to the servlet module). I have done this in \n2.1 without any ado as well.\n\nReopening M4 I got:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Oct 29, 2003 11:39:37.53\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Status Line Update\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.asyncExec(Display.java:471)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.progress.UIJob.run(UIJob.java:74)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:62)\n/Users/tim/eclipseM4/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/java_swt: no main class specified.\n/Users/tim/eclipseM4/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/java_swt: no main class specified.\n/Users/tim/eclipseM4/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/java_swt: no main class specified.\n\nI removed the symlink but continued to get the NPE... Let me know if there\u0027s any other info I can \nprovide as my workaround is to use 2.1 with external Ant builds.",
    "The three messages\n\"/Users/tim/eclipseM4/Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/java_swt: no main class specified.\"\nare strange.\nAre they in the .log or in the Console?\nHow are you launching Eclipse?\nWhat java version are you using? 1.4.1_01-99 or 1.4.1_01-69?",
    "Did you modify your Info.plist file?",
    "The messages are from the Console app. I opened it after seeing M4 die. I\u0027ve looked in ../\nworkspace/.metadata/.log and see the same thing:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Oct 29, 2003 11:39:36.527\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Status Line Update\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.asyncExec(Display.java:471)\n        at org.eclipse.ui.progress.UIJob.run(UIJob.java:74)\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:62)\n\nI\u0027m launching Eclipse by double-clicking on the icon and so see the 2-3 icons start in the Dock.\n\nI haven\u0027t edited anything in Eclipse.app as it runs with 1.4.1 (which is what I need to build):\n\n[nihau:~/eclipseM4/Eclipse.app/Contents] tim% ls -l\ntotal 16\n-rw-r--r--  1 tim  staff  1195 10 Oct 09:16 Info.plist\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 tim  staff   136 10 Oct 09:16 MacOS\n-rw-r--r--  1 tim  staff     8 10 Oct 09:16 PkgInfo\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 tim  staff   102 10 Oct 09:16 Resources\n\nI\u0027m running 01-99. I\u0027m aware of some 1.4.1 some people are having (something to do with QTJava) \nbut fortunately I don\u0027t have that problem. The machine is a factory installed 10.2 with a Panther \n10.3 upgrade immediately it came out of the box. \n\n[nihau:~/eclipseM4/Eclipse.app/Contents] tim% java -version\njava version \"1.4.1_01\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.1_01-99)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.1_01-27, mixed mode)\n\nI suspect that if I reinstalled it would run OK but it would be good to know how doing relatively \nstraightforward things break M4. The only thing I am sharing with 2.1 is jars which I keep in \neclipse/Jars. I\u0027d be surprised if that would upset M4.\n\n",
    "I\u0027m closing this bug because lots of stuff has changed in this area since last year.\nPlease, reopen if problem still exists."
