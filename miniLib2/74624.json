    "As per dorian birsan, I am entering this bug. I have tried on several occasions\nand several ways to update my Eclipse version 3.0.0 to 3.0.1. In every case the\noutcome was the same, Eclipse will not run. I can make it run by deleting the\nconfiguration directory, but then it thinks it is still in version 3.0.0 and\ncontinues to ask me if I want to update. I also end up with both the 3.0.0 and\nthe 3.0.1 versions of the files being loaded and who knows what kind of problems\nthat will create.\n\nI have entered a bug on the buildId not updating as a Runtime bug as per dorian\nbirsan. The bug # is 74621.\n\nThe update process takes 4-5 hours to download the files, there are one or more\nfiles that are \u0027unsigned\u0027, the update processes fails many times with a dialog\nto \u0027retry\u0027 and on one occasion it failed so bad I had to back up and start\nagain. Needless to say, with the overly long download times, I can only make one\nupdate attempt per day. And I have done this 4 times.\n\nI have even gone so far as to unzip 3.0.0 into C:\\Eclipse which created the\neclipse directory. Started Eclipse and went immediately to Help -\u003e Software\nUpdates -\u003e Manage Configuration, clicked on Scan for Updates and followed\nthe instructions to start the download. 4.5 hours later, after 8 retries\nand 1 complete restart, I get the \u0027Restart the Workbench\u0027 dialog box. Was\nI successful?\n\nNo. Same problem as before. The config.ini still has the original build Id\nin it and it still won\u0027t open.\n\nhere is the log file:\n\n!SESSION Sep 21, 2004 15:37:31.225

    "It looks like we\u0027ve found what the problem is:\nas lots of plugins are being downloaded, and eclipse site is very slow, \nsometimes the connect() fails and the IOException is masked, so the user is \nnot prompted to retry downloading. As such, downloading proceeds with the next \nplugin.\nWhat you end up with is an install with some plugins missing, and then things \njust break.",

I will do more tests, but if someone can give it a try please let me know\nif this helps at all. Thanks.",

    "Here is what\u0027s happening:\nSDK feature includes other features like Platform and JDT.\nAll plugins for Platform are downloaded.\nPlatform plug-ins and feature is installed (copied to plugins dir).\nLet\u0027s say a random connection failure occurs while downloading some JDT plug-\nin.\nSince SDK must be installed as a whole, the Platform plug-ins and feature are \nremoved.\nQuestion to retry.  User clicks yes (downloaded files for platform and jdt are \npreserved).\nPlatform is feature is installed again, but this time all its plug-ins are \nskipped because InstallRegistry.getInstance().isPluginJustInstalled\n(pluginsToInstall[i]) evaluates to true.\n\nJDT plug-ins that are missing are redownloaded and installed correctly.\n\nWe end up with Installation that is missing all plug-ins belonging to Platform \nfeature.\n\nPossible places for a quick fix (I have not tried or evaluted them for \nregressions):\nAdd a call InstallRegistry.unregisterPlugin(IPluginEntry pluginEntry) to \nSiteFilePluginContentConsumer.cleanup\nor\ncall InstallRegistry.cleanup() from InstallWizard.perfromFinish() before \ncontinuing to retry.",
    "The attachment has a fix for precisely the problem you describe.\nThe fix basically unregisters the \"justInstalledPlugins\" if the feature \ninstall did not succeed, so they will be re-installed next time (on retry).",
    "The fix does not correct this problem, because it unregisters \njustInstalledPlugins for a feature that just failed downloading (it had no \nplug-ins installed yet).\nThe feature that got installed prior, does not get its plug-ins unregistered, \nbut the feature and the plug-ins are deleted from the system.\n\nThe fix is still valuable as it may correct another (rare, but possible) \nfailure scenario - plug-ins missing if local disk IO error when installing non \nnested features.",
