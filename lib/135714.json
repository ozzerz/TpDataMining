    "Eclipse build: M6\nOS: Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003\n\nScenario:\n1. From the \"Data Source Explorer\" view, right-click on \"Databases\" --\u003e \"New\"\n2. From the \"New Connection Profile\" wizard, select \"Derby Embede Database\"\n3. Continue with the wizard till finishing the new connection profile creation.\n4. In the \"Data Source Explorer\" view, right-click on the recently created connection and click \"Connect\".\n\nExpected result:\nConnection is carried out successfully.\n\nActual result:\nConnection fails generating the following error message in the error log:\n\"\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2006-04-08 17:00:41.981\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Ping server job\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.internal.ConnectionProfile.createConnection(ConnectionProfile.java:310)\n\tat org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.ui.PingJob.run(PingJob.java:57)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\"\n\nRemarks:\n1. The same scenario was tested on M5 and it works fine.\n2. This is not Bidi-specific problem, however, it blocks Bidi defects verification activities.",
    "Maha,\nWhich build of DTP are you using? With the current one (4/7), I can complete the described steps on both Windows and Linux.",
    "John,\n\nFirst, I tested this scenarion on Eclipse M5 (DTP M5_N022706) and it was working fine. The re-running it on Eclipse M6 (DTP RC1_N032106) it failed producing the reported problem. Now, I\u0027m testing it on Eclipse I20060407 build (DTP RC1_N032106) and it works fine! I don\u0027t get it! Could it be some blugins conflict or so?",
    "Maha,\n\nPlease use the following:\nEclipse 3.2M6, EMF 2.2.0M6 and the latest GEF I-stream you find (I\u0027ve been using 20060331. Next, you\u0027ll want the 4/7 build of DTP 0.9, since that is confirmed to work against M6. Other combinations might cause problems.",
    "Have tried with a number of configurations (Windows, Linux, English locale, Japanese locale) and with a number of DTP committers. Cannot get current 0.9 stream to fail in the manner described. Will set as \"worksforme\" until further evidence (e.g. stack trace) or starts failing elsewhere too.",
    "All I\u0027ve to say is that currently it works for me too (using Eclipse build I20060407). Hopefully this would be the end of the problem.\n\nThank you John.",
