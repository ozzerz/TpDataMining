    "3.0 RC2\n\nThe following exception was printed during shutdown to the console. It was NOT \nlogged to the logfile. It should occured during shutdown and was only printed \nto \"System.err\". No steps to reproduce (may be a timing issue).\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.refresh.RefreshManager.refresh\n(RefreshManager.java:77)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.refresh.PollingMonitor.poll\n(PollingMonitor.java:161)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.refresh.PollingMonitor.run\n(PollingMonitor.java:122)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66)",
    "Refresh monitors should not be running after the resources plugin has shutdown\n(see bug 67632), but we need to guard against \"misbehaving\" refresh providers.\nThere should be a null check before all references to the refreshJob in\nRefreshProvider.java.\n\nCCing DJ for fix approval. Very safe fix, just adding the null check to avoid NPE.",
    "Jeff, will you be second approver on this? It is literally just an added null check:\n\npublic void refresh(IResource resources) {\n\t//do nothing if we have already shutdown\n\tif (refreshJob !\u003d null)// \u003c- added line\n\t\trefreshJob.refresh(resources);\n}\n",
