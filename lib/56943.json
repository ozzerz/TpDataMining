    "CDT 2.0.0.200403310806\nEclipse M8\n\nTest case:\n\n1. After installing CDT, the Problems view is on top by default.  Without\nchanging this ordering, create a managed project, call it MgdCpp (for example)\n2. Add a file to MgdCpp, call it main.cpp - this will kick off a build that\nnever finishes (because auto-build is enabled by default).\n3. Close Eclipse.\n\nResult: You are hung and must use the Windows Task Manager to force quit.\n\n4. Restart Eclipse.\n\nResult: Eclipse restarts, but note the progress bar in the botton right corner -\nthis should not be present.\n\n5. Close Eclipse again.\n\nResult: You are hung ....  again, and must use the Windows Task Manager to force\nquit ... again.\n\n6. Restart Eclipse one more time and you will get an error message pointing you\nto a log file in the configuration directory that will contain something that\nlooks like this:\n\n!SESSION Mar 31, 2004 13:28:24.390 ---------------------------------------------\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_02\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi Mar 31, 2004 13:28:24.406\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to locate application extension:\norg.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run(PlatformActivator.java:263)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:239)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:117)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:267)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:692)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:676)\n\n\nNow you cannot launch Eclipse at all and the only way to solve the problem is to\ndelete your configuration and workspace directory.",

    "I see a similar problem now using the latest from CVS.  I was investigating \nhttps://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d53620 which has a particular piece \nof source from Linux kernal (or tests, I\u0027m not sure).  Was this defect fixed for \nour M8 (and just not marked as RESOLVED) or does anyone else still see the \nproblem.\n\nMy steps to reproduce it:\n1. Create new Managed Make (C) project.\n2. Import fw-emu.c.  (Will be attached shortly).\n3. Autobuild should kick in (without setting up include paths, you\u0027ll get \ncompile errors).\n4. While build is going on, attempt to dirty the editor buffer.  (i.e. type in \nCEditor)\n5. DEADLOCK\n\nAfter killing it and starting Eclipse back up, there are errors opening editors \nand seeing the C++ Projects View.  It takes a couple of restarts/refreshes/Reset \nPerspectives to get things going again.\n\nI am running on SuSE Linux 9.0, Eclipse M8 for GTK, w/Sun\u0027s JDK 1.4.2.  I have \nattached the different stack traces of all the threads that were blocking \nsuspicously, but my take on it is that CMarkerAnnotationModel (which is an \nIResourceChangeListener) is doing tons of work, including notifying other \nlisteners of annotation changes, and one of these listeners is creating SWT \nImages for the label provider.  We need to restructure our MarkerAnnotationModel \nto use runnables or work-queues.\n",

    "The original problem was fixed for M8 and just not marked as resolved from the \nlooks of it ;)\n\nI tried to reproduce the problem you mentioned on both Windows XP and SLES 9.\n\nWindows XP:\nThe UI locked up when I typed in the CEditor, though if I left it long enough - \nit would come back and appear to complete the failed build.  When I exited from \nmy Eclipse session, I was prompted with the \"blocking\" dialog telling me that I \ncould not exit until the build was complete (which was the case according to \nthe console view prior to exiting) - though after a finite amount of time, \nEclipse did close down.  So something is certainly wonky here.  There were no \nerrors reported to the .log file.\n\nSLES 9:\nI experience the deadlock you described.  I waited 10 minutes and the UI never \ncame back.  There were no errors reported to the .log file.\n",
    "So I guess my problem that I have witnessed this morning is the same as John\u0027s.\n\nI will duplicate my critical bug that I have logged this morning to this one.  \n(Can\u0027t delete a line of code when a large file is opened in the editor).The \nbuild mechanism was running in the background.\n\n",
    "*** Bug 58134 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "This defect was originally raised because IProblem markers were preventing \nmanaged make from completing a build. This has been fixed and as a result is \nno longer blocking - hence I am closing this bug...and opening a new one for \nthe other problem stated below.\n\nHowever, there is another problem here - which appears on Linux but apparently \nnot Windows. If you have a file that has many build errors (such as the one \nprovided by John), it takes an amazingly long time to get the error output. In \nfact if you type something in the CEditor while the project is building it \nfreezes up the editor.  (This problem has to do with the \nCEditorErrorTickUpdater taking a long time to refresh). BTW, it is not \ndeadlocked as it eventually comes around but it does take a very long time to \nget all the errors.",
