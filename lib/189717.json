    "Build ID: 3.2.0\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. RCP application works correctly when using WebStart Java 1.5.0_07.\n2. Install WebStart Java 1.6.0_01 on your PC.\n3. RCP application no longer works. Loading the JNLP file results in the following error being logged:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat java.util.Hashtable.put(Unknown Source)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.WebStartMain.basicRun(WebStartMain.java:58)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:977)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.WebStartMain.main(WebStartMain.java:40) \n....\n\nPlease note that this is a problem with the WebStart load. It doesn\u0027t matter whether you specify in your JNLP file for the code to run in Java 5 or Java 6. It\u0027s a problem with the way that the application gets launched.\n\nI have had a good look at the other similar bugs here, none of them mention this error message specifically. I don\u0027t feel that this is a duplicate.\n\nMore information:\nThe error has been experienced by other developers. Described here:\n\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform.rcp/msg17789.html\n\nSomething to note is that RCP + Java 6 does not seem to respond to the @user.home directive properly. I wonder if the @ is being URL encoded on the way into RCP so that the replacement doesn\u0027t get done? What you end up with is a directory called @user.home sat on your Windows desktop.",
