    "Build ID: I20070625-1500\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1.Installed  Eclipse 3.3 with TPTP 4.4 plugins on Windows platform and the Auto GUI Recorder plugins 4.4.0.1 versions\n \n2.Created the Test container as mentioned in the Eclipse TPTP. I have recorded a few scenarios using the GUI Recorder plugin controls and then tried to run them together in standard mode of execution which will generate a log file .\n3.The Standard mode of execution involves three stages :\n (i). Creation of a location file\n(ii).Creation of an artifact  file\n(iii). Creation of a Deployment file.\n \nI have followed all the steps but when I launch the test container  with the new configuration and then select the test suit created and the Deployment file and then click on the Apply and OK  Buttons\nThe progress of the execution starts and then after a while it stops at 36%\nAlso a message appears as ?Preparing and Deploying?\nAfter sometime it fails with a message as :\norg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\nIWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.handleException(TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.java:347)\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.launch(TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.java:434)\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.launchTestExecution(TestExecutionHarness.java:2098)\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.access$2(TestExecutionHarness.java:1830)\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$2.run(TestExecutionHarness.java:750)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)\nCaused by: org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.launch(TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.java:422)\n.. 4 more\n \nIWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\nAn exception stack trace is not available\n \n \nCould you please assist me out in trouble shooting this issue.?\n \nIn Quick mode , we can select all the earlier recorded tests at a tretch and then run them together but we don?t have a method to verify the log file as per my understanding.\n \nThanks\u0026Regards,\nBalakrishna\n\n\nMore information:",

    "Updating priority since the Test Project will only fix critical and blocking defects for the Technology Previews (Manual Test, API Recorder, and AGR) in 4.5 o accommodate the decrease in resources.",
    "Cannot contain in 4.5 plan.",
    "In TPTP 4.5, the AGR was moved from a Technology Preview component to an As-Is component. As-Is components are primarily provided for prior users but imply no support (for example, defects, news group, and mailing lists) or commitment to triage or resolve opened defects. For this defect to be considered, please re-open with an attached patch including code to resolve the symptom and test cases to test the fix."
