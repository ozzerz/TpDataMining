    "Hi there,\n\nThis is an Derby embedded driver exception. It usually happens when two applications/threads want to visit one database. As per Derby driver\u0027s restriction, one database can only be visited by one application/thread at a time.\n\nThe suggestion to your problem is that you may user Derby Network server driver which allow concurrent access to the database. For details please refer to Derby online manual http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.3/getstart/\n\nThanks.\nLin",
    "\nThanks for the information.\n\nBut I am ensure that only one application is running on my machine and accessing mysql database. \n\nMy Struts application accessing mysql database which is running on my machine and .rptdesign file is accessing some other database which is on the internet. (example sampledatabase,etc.)So I think, the problem is not with mysql concurrent access(the reason, which you have given). \n\nI feel, due to that lack of BIRT performance....\n\nOtherwise it may be a BIRT version problem. Say an example, A .rptdesign file has been designed by using BIRT 2.0, If my struts application using BIRT 2.1. In that case, do we get such kind of problem?\n\nI am verymuch struggling with this problem. Pls help and give me a correct solution.\n\nThanks \u0026 Regards.\nArivazhagan Kannan\n",
    "Hi,\n\nCan you attach the report design that of problem?\n\nThe error message is thrown by Derby Embedded driver.As you\u0027ve mentioned that the report design is accessing some databases in internet, I wonder whether the Derby database is also accessed online. If that is the case the Derby embedded driver is not valid for such access.\n\nA report design can help us to go further on this problem.\n\nThanks.\nLin",
    "Hi There,\n\nAny updates?\n\nThanks.\nLin",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d77687)\nrepord design file,\n\nHi,\n \nThere is nothing like the particular report design file will throws that exception. I am getting that exception very rarely for some of the report design files. Still I am finding a solution.\n\nError example Scenario:\n\nIf I assign a job using this report design file with very less time frequency, ie., One report per second for 20 or more times(repeatedtly). \n\n \nI am requesting you to update me, If u have any solution. And I attached report design file also.\n \nThanks \u0026 Regards\n \nArivazhagan Kannan\nExtentia Info Tech.\n"
