    "Created an attachment (id\u003d9516)\nThe Testdata sef.zip\n\nThe test.release file is not opened in the runtime workbench",
    "What is the PDE team\u0027s intention on this one?  The DBCS testers have flagged \nthis one as a critical bug.  We need to get a response back to them.\n",
    "David, could you please try to recreate this on the latest SLES and Eclipse \nlevels?  We think this may be a user error, but want to make sure.\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d11599)\nScreen Shot of error message we received\n\nJonathan and I both tried to recreate this on a SLES and Windows 2003 machine\nrespectively.  We had some trouble following your instructions, as we couldn\u0027t\nadd anything on the dependancy tab.\n\nWe did proceed to open another workbench and when trying to view the\ntest.release file, an error message was printed to the screen.\tYou can see\nthat screenshot on the attachment.",
    "Testing against 20040610\n\nWhen I import the plug-in using Import External Plugins I got the following \nexception\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.imports.PluginImportOperation.importAsBinar\nyWithLinks(PluginImportOperation.java:191)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.imports.PluginImportOperation.importPlugin\n(PluginImportOperation.java:121)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.imports.PluginImportOperation.run\n(PluginImportOperation.java:80)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.run\n(Workspace.java:1673)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.run\n(Workspace.java:1693)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.imports.PluginImportWizard$2.run\n(PluginImportWizard.java:104)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run\n(ModalContext.java:101)\n\nso I couldn\u0027t go any further. Did you import it this way?",
    "I used import...-\u003efilesystem to import it into a simple project.\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d11914)\nText.release editor\n\nTangible evidence that the editor opens correctly in a runtime workbench.",
    "I fixed the NPE reported by my good friend Tod in comment #5, but it is \nunrelated to this defect.\n\nObservations:\n1. The project in question is actually setup to be imported using the standard \nimport wizard.  It has a hardcoded classpath that does not use classpath \ncontainers, etc., so it requires tweaking before it compiles.\n2. The plugin in question is a 2.1 plugin.  Your target platform needs to be \n2.x-based.  The target platform in comment #4 must have been 3.0 based.  That \nis why you get that error.  A 2.1 plugin needs to go through the cool \nmigration wizard before it becomes 3.0 friendly.\n\nOnce you set your target platform correctly, and you get your project to \ncompile, you can launch a runtime workbench, paste the text file and open it \nin the editor.",
    "\u003e 2-Open the plug_in.xml and press Depandency Tab , add all plug-in , Save it.\nI recommend that you never do that.  Gratuitous dependencies severely impede \nclassloading performance, and your plugin will be disabled if any of those \ndependencies is missing."
