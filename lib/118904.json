    "I was editing a java class when I got an error dialog with the message \"An internal error occurred during: \"Requesting Java AST from selection\".\"\n\nOnce the error dialog appeared, it would not go away - if I closed it, it would reopen.  I had to shut down eclipse.  Now it seems I can\u0027t use this workspace because the error dialog appears shortly after I start editing the class.\n\neclipse.buildId\u003dI20051130-1215\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_03\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den\nFramework arguments:  -showlocation\nCommand-line arguments:  -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -debug -clean -showlocation -clean\n\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JavaEditor.updateOccurrenceAnnotations(JavaEditor.java:2917)\nat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JavaEditor$6.selectionChanged(JavaEditor.java:2932)\nat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.viewsupport.SelectionListenerWithASTManager$PartListenerGroup.calculateASTandInform(SelectionListenerWithASTManager.java:173)\nat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.viewsupport.SelectionListenerWithASTManager$3.run(SelectionListenerWithASTManager.java:142)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)",
    "Please provide that class otherwise it\u0027s hard to track this down.",
    "Best would be to give us access to that blocked workspace.\n\nNot that the \"dialog\" you see is not a modal dialog i.e. you can simply go and close the editor. But before doing so, please give us the workspace.",
    "The class I was editing was Image.\n\nI still have the workspace but it is no longer giving me this error.  I have since closed all the editors.",
    "Does it come back if you open Image?",
    "No.\n\nI had the error occur three times.  I shut down eclipse, restarted it and the problem appeared shortly after I tried to edit the class.  Then the fourth time it stopped occuring.  I do not know what I did differently to stop it.",
    "Reopening to close as dup.\n\nReducing severity:\n- it is not blocking: the editor can be closed and then reopened - no need to \n  restart\n- disabling occurrence marking removes the problem\n",
