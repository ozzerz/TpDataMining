    "While using I20070206-0010 I got the following printed to my xterm:\n\nException in thread \"Text Viewer Hover Presenter\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.text.PluginXMLTextHover.getElementText(PluginXMLTextHover.java:157)\n        at org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.text.PluginXMLTextHover.getHoverInfo(PluginXMLTextHover.java:63)\n        at org.eclipse.jface.text.TextViewerHoverManager$4.run(TextViewerHoverManager.java:160)\n\nThere is nothing in my error log.\nPW",
    "Hey Mike, can you take a look at this when you get a chance since you are the resident plugin.xml expert",
    "Hi Paul,\n\nI can see how this is possible; but, I am having trouble coming up with a\nreproducible scenario.  From the stack trace it appears that you had the\nplug-in manifest editor open on the (source) plugin.xml page and hovered \nover an element / attribute / object to trigger the exception.\nCan you reproduce the problem?  If so, could you provide the plugin.xml file\nyou were using and the thing you hovered over?\n\nIn any event, I have added a boundary case to guard against the NPE.\nPatch released to HEAD. I just want to verify that I indeed fixed the problem\n(and not covering up some other problem)\n\nI think the reason, nothing showed up in your log is because there is a\nmissing catch all block in TextViewerHoverManager - The thread is not \nguarded against NPEs.\n\nTransferring over to the platform UI team to investigate that problem.",
