    "Created an attachment (id\u003d77168)\nPossible patch\n\nI need to align the colors of the PGroup to those used e.g. by Eclipse-Tabs. This is currently not possible.\n\nI\u0027m not sure maybe we should think about a generic solution to make Nebula-Widgets like PGroup, PShelf more aligned to the L\u0026F Eclipse else they make them look like they don\u0027t fit in the UI.",
    "Ok. The patch is nonesense but because there\u0027s already the setBackground-API which has some minor problems though:\n1. Calling setBackground before the strategy is set onto a PGroup leads to an NPE\n2. The border-color is not updated\n\nTo me it looks like an API flaw that PGroup is not passed in the constructor",
    "Number 2 is correct because people should call the setBorderColor-API for this number one still remains.",
    "The PGroup isn\u0027t passed into the constructor to make it easy on typical developers who new them up.  The PGroup is passed into the initialize method.\n\nThe whole color situation with PGroup is complicated and confusing I agree.  The strategy pattern causes difficulty.  Each strategy may have a different set of colors (and even a different # of colors).  So some colors can be set on the PGroup using setBackground/setForeground, but other colors beyond that might need to be set on the renderer.  Alternatively I could require all colors to be set directly on the renderer and ignore whats set on the widget itself.  I open to suggestions.\n\nRegarding the NPE - I haven\u0027t seen this.  Can you post a quick stack trace?",
