    "On mac the eclipse.ini file prepends our jdi.jar file to the boot classpath. The new plugin version numbers break this support.\nie the jar file that used to be in org.eclipse.jdt.debug_3.1.0, but now the jdt.debug plugin is version as 3.2.0.qualifier which puts our jdi.jar in a directory something like org.eclipse.jdt.debug_3.2.0.v20051128\n\nAs a result, we\u0027re finding apple\u0027s jdi implementation instead of our own and getting these errors in the console.\n\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: com.sun.jdi.VirtualMachineManager.createVirtualMachine(Lcom/sun/jdi/connect/spi/Connection;)Lcom/sun/jdi/VirtualMachine;\n\tat org.eclipse.jdi.internal.connect.ConnectorImpl.establishedConnection(ConnectorImpl.java:98)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdi.internal.connect.SocketListeningConnectorImpl.accept(SocketListeningConnectorImpl.java:129)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.launching.StandardVMDebugger$ConnectRunnable.run(StandardVMDebugger.java:78)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:552)",
    "Todd, this is another effect of the MacOS X problem that Apple has decided not to leave the jdi library in tools.jar but to move it into classes.jar. This is non-standard (with respect to Windows and linux) and makes it very hard for IDE providers to achieve platform independence.\nFor us it means that we have to modify the bootclasspath to work around this problem. Since the bootclasspath is global, modifying it breaks plugin encapsulation and really is an ugly thing to do.\n\nCould you find out why this non-standard move has been done?\nI\u0027ve already filed radar bug 3869178 for this.",
    "Bug 118631 has been raised to address a more general version of the problem with version numbers.  To get things working for now, I\u0027ve written a small patch to the buildscripts that uses the ant replace task to modify the macosx eclipse.ini file.  Sonia, can you please review this, I modified the sdk component, will the other components require something similar?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d30867)\npatch to buildscripts\n\n",
    "This looks fine, though I would like to run a test build first.  I will aim to release for the next N build.",
    "This is still broken in I20051206.\nWithout this fix debugging isn\u0027t possible.",
    "The change to the /Eclipse.app/Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini is not being picked up,  the map file org.eclipse.releng/maps/swt.map needs to be updated to v3218 for the org.eclipse.platform.launchers feature.\n\n",
    "This should get picked up correctly in the next build.",
    "*** Bug 119871 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Fixed in 3.2 M4.",
    "(fixed)",
    "Verified."
