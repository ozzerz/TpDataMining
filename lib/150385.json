    "The WSDM Managed Agent Explorer (MAX) can connect to and managed WSDM based resources.  In order to do this, we leverage the Apache Muse project which provides the implementation of the WSDM client.  \n\nThe purpose of this feature is to track the introduction of the code dependency on the Apache Muse project.  As a side note, the Corona Project will also have this dependency and we could work with that team as well.",
    "This is an feature enhancement.  We\u0027ll track it as a 4.3 enhancement but if the necessary approvals are received in time for 4.2.1 it will be included with the 4.2.1 tech preview.",
    "adding investigate keywork pending the addition of description doc and sizing",
    "Reviewed and approved by AG on July 17",
    "Changed to plan state as description document and sizing have been reviewed and approved by TPTP Architecture Group.",
    "This is targetted to complete in 4.3 iteration 2 (Code complete Sept. 8)\n",
    "Retargeting to 4.4 as the EMO is only now reviewing these",
    "Removed plan keyword and changed version to future because this feature has been deferred from the 4.3 plan.",
    "Changing version to 4.4 and increasing priority as it is a requirement for 4.4.  This feature will be used to track the EMO approval for TPTP to redistribute Apache Muse and the necessary work to package it once it is approved.",
    "Making the Summary more general to include all of the WSDM support in the TPTP Monitoring Tools project.",
    "Adding sizing and setting target.",
    "Changing to more appropriate component.  WSDM Tooling is currently tracked under the Monitor.UI.ManagedResourcesExplorer component.",
