    "Steps To Reproduce:\n1. Start external AC w/ security on, on a Linux machine.\n2. Open Linux Workbench. Open profiling dialog. Create a new external application profiling entry.\n3. Authenticate when asked.\n4. Click profile.\n\nA \u0027warning\u0027 message dialog pops up, \"One of the selected launch delegates has failed.\"\n\nAlong with the exception:\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException\nAgent Controller is unavailable under port 10002. Make sure that the service is started and the port number is correct under preferences.\n\norg.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.exceptions.AgentControllerUnavailableException: Error: Unable to connect to the Agent Controller.Connection reset\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.client.core.internal.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:128)\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.util.internal.AgentControllerFActory$EstablishConnection.run(AgentControllerFactory.java:126)\n  at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:801)Z\n\nMore information:\n\nWhen I started the ACServer, I received a message saying \u0027libssl.so.2\u0027 was missing. I had libssl on my system as /usr/lib/libssl.so.0.9.7. I created a symbolic link, libssl.so.2 -\u003e libssl.so.0.9.7. This allowed the ACServer to run, and I was able to profile (in non-secure mode) after this. Not sure if this is related, but thought I\u0027d let you know.\n\nOn Linux, External AC, TPTP-4.4.1-200709101254, IBM 1.5 JVM.",
    "Resolving since dependence on openssl is removed and libssl library isn\u0027t currently required."
