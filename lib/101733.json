    "I ran into the same exception using the I20050624 I-build.  I believe the \nearlier code above is from I20050603 and no longer compiles because \nIVirtualComponent no longer extends IVirtualContainer.  However, I found that \nthe following code throws the same exception in I20050624 when run with a \nfreshly created J2EE Web Project:\n\nIVirtualComponent mod \u003d flexProj.getComponent(\"webapp_name\");\nIVirtualFolder root \u003d mod.getRootFolder();\nIVirtualResource [] resArray \u003d root.getResources(\"\");\nfor (int i \u003d 0; i \u003c resArray.length; i++) {\n    IResource res \u003d resArray[i].getUnderlyingResource();\n}\n\nThis code has the same issue with getFolder() that the earlier code does.\n\nThe code I had that was similar to that above no longer behaves the same as it \ndid in M4, so it is no longer useful to me.  However, regardless of its \nusefulness, I wouldn\u0027t expect it to throw an exception.  There may be other \nmore useful scenarios that might have the same problem with getFolder().",
    "Forgot to mention that the getFolder() problem occurs when getUnderlyingResource\n() is called on the resArray entry that refers to the root folder itself.",
    "This problem was fixed in recent Integration builds i am not sure about the\nexact build but please verify 07/11 Integration build and reopen if still see\nthe problem",
    "Closing."
