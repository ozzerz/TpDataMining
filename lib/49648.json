    "I removed plugin com.atlassw.tools.eclipse.checkstyle_3.2.0.1. I thought it was\ncausing an error \u0027Problems occurred with invoking code from plug-in:\n\"org.eclipse.core.runtime\". I removed the plug-in from my plugin directory. \n\nWhen I restarted Eclipse context menus no longer worked on the Package Explorer,\nHierarchy, Outline, Junit, Debug, any of CVS views. They still work on the Ant\nview, the editor, the Error Log. The preference dialog displays with nothing\nshowing in the list box or on the dialog. Right click on the an Error Log item\nand selecting the properties menu choice also fails. Eclipse is pretty much\nhosed. I have restarted Eclipse twice. I plan to next restart the PC to see, if\nthis affect it.\n\nI will attach my .log file in moment",

    "Rebooting had no affect on the problem. I zipped up my metadata directory and\nrestarted Eclipse. The problem still occurred. Eclipse also was confused during\nthe process of importing projects. \n\nI also had a different project directory setup for this version of Eclipse. This\nwork area doesn\u0027t have any of the projects found in my main work area. I thought\nthe problem might be was caused by a corrupted .project file or other project\nrelated file, but this work area was also corrupted.\n\n",
