    "Using eclipse-SDK-I20051130-1215-win32 \nreceived below class cast exception. \n\nI had recently started a fresh workspace, and was importing team project set \nfrom a 3.1.1 workspace (and hit cancel when asked for a repository password \nI didn\u0027t understand). \n\nAnd, I was doing several things at once, so not sure if releated, but I had\nalso recently imported (all) preferences from a 3.1.1 based dev. env. \n\nIf it matters, I\u0027m \"running\" on a JDK 1.5 Java runtime. \nJ2RE 1.5.0 IBM Windows 32 build pwi32dev-20051104\n\nI kept getting the class cast exception (in console log) .. just diplayed error dialog once) ... and not problems/warnings displayed. \n\nI closed and re-opened problems veiw and all seemed fine after that. \n\nBTW, ...
