    "Followed all the steps in http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/RSE_1.0_Test_Instructions\n\nto download the bits. Created a remote connection (HP-UX running 11.11) and was exploring one of the directory and clicked on a .ppt file. Eclipse crashed. After that Eclipse is not coming up at all! It is crashing at the time of startup.\n\nI will attach the .log file content.\n\n-----------Enter bugs above this line-----------\nRSE 1.0 Testing round 1\ninstallation : eclipse-platform-3.2 (M20060629-1905), cdt-3.1.0\nRSE install  : update-site RSE-complete\njava.runtime : Sun 1.5.0_08-b03\nos.name:     : Windows XP 5.1, Service Pack 2\n------------------------------------------------\nsystemtype   : Unix-ssh (dstore-processes)\ntargetos     : SUSE LINUX 10.1 (i586)\ntargetuname  : Linux osgiliath 2.6.16.21-0.21-default #1 Tue Aug 29 16:42:05 UTC 2006 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux\ntargetvm     : Sun Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_07-b03, mixed mode, sharing)\n------------------------------------------------",

You are right. I got confused about the heading \"Enter bugs above this line\". I should have updated the configuration info below the \"Enter bugs above this line\". I re-installed the eclipse 3.2 platform, cdt 3.1.0 sdk and RSE sdk. I am attaching the configuration details as a seperate file.\n\nI have not used \"dstore\" yet. I was creating the remote connection by using \"ssh-only\". ",

    "I cannot reproduce the crash with a PPT file I tried.\n\nThe PPT file opens in a standard Eclipse Text editor on the dblclick operation. Open With \u003e Default Editor, or Text Editor, does the same. Open with \u003e System Editor opens the file in Powerpoint.\n\nI suppose that your PPT file was special in some kind, such that it crashed the Eclipse editor by itself. \n\nCan you also reproduce the crash when you open the file from a normal Eclipse Project? To test this, do New \u003e Project \u003e General \u003e Project, then drag \u0026 drop the ppt file into the new project, then dbl click it. If it crashes, please file a bug against Platform / Text Editor. They will want to have your ppt file I guess, so you better test with a file that you can give away.\n\nLooking again at the excxeptions in your log, it looks like your PPT file was perhaps very large. I tried with a 236K file. Perhaps SWT ran out of handles for you because the file was too large; After quit \u0026 restart eclpise, Eclipse tries to re-open the same editor as before and the same problem happens again. Note that for problems like this, enhancement bug 117746 is open against the Platform.\n\n\n\nFor completeness, here is the correct system info:\n-----------Enter bugs above this line-----------\nRSE 1.0 Testing round 1\ninstallation : eclipse-platform-3.2 (M20060629-1905), cdt-3.1.0-sdk\nRSE install  : donload RSE-sdk\njava.runtime : Sun 1.4.2_10-b03\nos.name:     : Windows XP 5.1, Service Pack 2\n------------------------------------------------\nsystemtype   : Unix-ssh\ntargetos     : HP-UX 11.11\ntargetuname  : \ntargetvm     : \n------------------------------------------------\n",

    "When the .ppt file is local, no problem. If I open it with the system editor, the file is opened using PowerPoint. But when the same file is remote, eclipse crashes again. After that crash, eclipse dies when I try to execute eclipse.exe again.  ",

    "Sumit, could you send us the PPT file in question for further analysis?",
    "I\u0027ve tried this but I can\u0027t reproduce this.  Martin what did you do to get the stack you\u0027ve shown?",
    "I alsou couldnt reproduce it. The stack is copied out of the .log file that Sumit attached. Sumit -- is there any chance you could give us the ppt file? Perhaps by direct private E-Mail? Our bugzilla accounts are our standard E-mail addresses you can use.",
    "I can\u0027t share the ppt file, as it has confidential data. I tried reproducing with a smaller ppt file, but was not successful. I installed the eclipse/cdt/RSE on the 3rd location to reproduce the problem. I will update you, if I can reproduce it. Eclipse does not come up in my first 2 installations. ",
    "I\u0027m dropping the severity and priority since this is difficult to reproduce.",
    "Actually, as per comment 12 Sumit has an action item to try and reproduce this on another system, or with a PPT file that he can share. If he can not reproduce it by end of the week, I\u0027d mark it as WORKSFORME.",
    "Decreasing to severity normal / P4 since this is not reproducable.\n\nThe problem might actually be due to bug 161200: when the binary ppt file is downloaded, and opened in the Eclipse text editor instead of the system editor, SWT might run out of handles trying to open it -- but the real bug is that the text editor should not be used on the file.",
    "I think this problem should be fixed now that 161200 is fixed."
