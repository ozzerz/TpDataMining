    "I have a managed C++ project which is checked into a team system (perforce).  Most types of edits \nwork as expected;  e.g. if I open a read-only .cpp file, and start typing, the editor seems to notify the \nperforce plug-in, the command \"open for edit\" is issued, the file is made writeable, and I can start \ntyping.\n\nHowever, this fails when attempting to edit the c/c++ project settings, and .cdtbuild is non-writeable.  \nSpecific steps:\nRight click on the project file, select \"properties\"\nMake some sort of change to C++ properties (e.g. define a new preprocessor #define value)\nClose the dialog\n\nActual results / Specific bugs:\n1.  vi .cdtbuild and note that the changes were not committed\n2.  No error was noted for the user (silent failure)\n3.  Errors written to logfile, workspace/.metadata/.log:\n...\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Could not write to\nread-only file: /Servercode/.cdtbuild.\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.localstore.FileSystemResourceManager.write(FileSystemResourceManager.java:\n735)\n...\n\nDesired results:\n1.  Active team plugin used to open .cdtbuild (and/or .cdtproject) for editing\n\n\nVersions:\nfedora core 3, latest updates\neclipse 3.0.1\ncdt 2.0.2\np4wsad 2004.2.2485",

    "\nI have implemented a fix to resolve this problem. I have tested my solution for \nthe case where the .cdtbuild file is read-only, and the behavior is as \nexpected. The fix uses an underlying Eclipse routine that should handle \ninteraction with supported source code repositories properly, but I do not have \naccess to the repository listed in the problem report. Could the bugzilla \nreporter try the fix in that environment? Regardless, though, what I have done \ndefinitely improves the behavior that occurs when there are problems attempting \nto write to the .cdtbuild file. \n\nI believe that this fix will be available in CDT v3.1.\n\nBob Monteleone \n",
