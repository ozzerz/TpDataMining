    "The problem is with OSGI dependency. In class TextExecutionHarness \nconstructor, an OSGI class is tempted to be loaded, if successful, it\u0027s used \nas a indication of running inside the workbench. \n\nClass.forName(TestExecutionHarness.STANDALONE_INDICATOR_CLASS);\n\nIn case of standalone execution, osgi is not expected to be on the classpath \nso the loading will fail and everything will work as standalone from this \npoint on. In the private launchTest() method, \norg.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.Job is used which depends on osgi and thus will \nfail.\n\t\t\nJob monitor \u003d new Job(executionResultName)",

    "\nStandalone mode is now prepared correctly.\n\nThe standalone indicator class is now not used -- instead the \nPlatform.getProduct() method is invoked and the result is compared to null.  \nIf the result is null then the harness is being run in standalone mode, if non-\nnull it is being run within a product in non-standalone mode.\n\nStandalone mode will be replaced by headless mode in the near future (4.1+) \nfor test execution and this will have to be re-examined at that time and \ndeprecated to make way for the recommended approach for launching tests \noutside of the IDE."
