    "I use recent builds of Eclipse 3.0 (not sure if I used RC1) without any\nproblems. Veronika, could some more info? How far does it go, what error\nmessages are produced, is there any log in the configuration area\n(\u003ctimestamp\u003e.log) or workspace?\n\nYou may also want to try running with:\n\ncd \u003cECLIPSE_HOME\u003e\n\u003cJAVA_HOME\u003e/bin/java -cp startup.jar \u003cyour other VM args\u003e\norg.eclipse.core.launcher.Main \u003cyour other Eclipse args\u003e\n\nIf it is a VM crash, that should show it.\n\n",
    "I get an error dialog that says \"Framework not found\" but no error log.\n\nI will try the way described in comment #1.",
    "Get:\n\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not find framework\n   at org.eclipse.runtime.core.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:357)\n   ...",
    "Managed to get eclipse to start.\n\nApparently, I can not share the same eclipse installation between Windows NT \nand Windows 98 - even if they use completely different workspaces.  Must be a \nfile system thing.  Sorry about that, I guess I will just close this bug \nreport."
