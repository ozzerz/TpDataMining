    "I have a jspc task in my ant script to do a test compile of jsp pages\nThis worked under 3.0 but I get an exception to stdout under 3.1\n\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: -1\n        at java.lang.String.substring(String.java:1444)\n        at org.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.AntUtil.getLocationLink(AntUtil.java:491)\n        at\norg.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.RemoteAntBuildListener.generateLink(RemoteAntBuildListener.java:255)\n        at\norg.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.RemoteAntBuildListener.receiveTaskMessage(RemoteAntBuildListener.java:243)\n        at\norg.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.RemoteAntBuildListener.receiveMessage(RemoteAntBuildListener.java:173)\n        at\norg.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.RemoteAntBuildListener$ServerConnection.run(RemoteAntBuildListener.java:104)\n\n\nAnt file that produces the same bug looks like:\n\n\u003cproject name\u003d\"Example\" default\u003d\"prepare\" basedir\u003d\".\"\u003e\n\t\u003ctarget name\u003d\"prepare\"\u003e\n\t\u003cmkdir dir\u003d\"${basedir}/work/org/apache/jsp\" /\u003e\n\t\u003cjspc srcdir\u003d\"${basedir}\" destdir\u003d\"${basedir}/work/org/apache/jsp\"\npackage\u003d\"org.apache.jsp\"  \u003e\n\t\t\u003cinclude name\u003d\"*.jsp\" /\u003e\n\t\u003c/jspc\u003e\n\u003c/target\u003e\n\u003c/project\u003e",
    "Thank you for the bug report.\nCan you provide a sample of the output that is causing the exception.\nWith my quick tests I have been unable to reproduce the exception.",

    "I ran into this and \u0027fixed\u0027 it by adding a (if index \u003d\u003d -1) return null; on the\nline prior to 491\n\nthe only thing weird I did was replace the default ANT_HOME with one from my project\n",
    "ok some more info\n\nmy project has a custom ant task to do the compiling I get the exception when\neclipse tries to build a link (so that I can click on the task name and have the\nsource brought up)\nthe getLocationLink is supposed to be called with filename:line number\nbut I only get filename\nthe code looks backwards for the : and converts everything after it to a number\non windows the exception is not seen but the link is not built either, the\nreason for this is that the paramter is:\nc:\\project\\srs\\a\\a.java\nso it parses the paramter to:\nfilename: c\nline number: \\project\\srs\\a\\a.java\nthen the line number is converted to a number which of course fails and the\nthrown excpetion is caught and null is returned.  end result is on windows the\nexception is not seen but the link not there\nwith my fix I handle the case of no : found and return null thus causing the\nsame result\nsomeone that knows eclipse ant needs to test this on a unix platform and find a\nbetter fix, but till then my fix is better than what is there now\n",
    "I\u0027m having the same symptoms on Unix (Mac OS X) with the xmlbean custom task.  The console stops \nprinting the ant build progress although the build appears to continue.  Of course I don\u0027t know what it\u0027s \ndoing from that point forwards.  This occurs with Version: 3.1.0 Build id: I20050627-1435 but didn\u0027t with \n3.0 using exact same build file.",
    "I did some rework in AntUtil to handle this case and to bail less expensively: \nno linenumber no need to go look for a file.",
