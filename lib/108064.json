    "We had to have release engineering delete a revision (i.e. rollback).  Eclipse\nhad no idea what to do during synchronizes, compares, etc.  \n\nI had to explicitly replace with an older version of the file in question after\nseveral other attempts to clean-up my environment were greeted with no response\nfrom Eclipse, including an empty error message alert box.\n\nThis can be reproduced by:\n1) Get the latest version of a file in your workspace\n2) Have the cvsadmin/release-engineer delete that revision (for example using RCS)\n3) Attempt to synchronize that file within Eclipse.\n\nSome of the interesting entries from the log were as follows:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 0 2005-08-25 14:38:40.177\n!MESSAGE The server reported an error while performing the \"cvs update\" command.\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSServerException: The server\nreported an error while performing the \"cvs update\" command.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderTreeBuilder.fetchDelta(RemoteFolderTreeBuilder.java:625)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderTreeBuilder.buildTree(RemoteFolderTreeBuilder.java:291)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderTreeBuilder.buildRemoteTree(RemoteFolderTreeBuilder.java:143)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.CVSWorkspaceRoot.getRemoteTree(CVSWorkspaceRoot.java:173)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.syncinfo.CVSResourceVariantTree.fetchVariant(CVSResourceVariantTree.java:80)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.core.variants.AbstractResourceVariantTree.refresh(AbstractResourceVariantTree.java:86)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.syncinfo.CVSResourceVariantTree.refresh(CVSResourceVariantTree.java:327)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.core.variants.AbstractResourceVariantTree.refresh(AbstractResourceVariantTree.java:55)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.core.variants.ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.refresh(ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java:160)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.core.variants.ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.refresh(ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.java:125)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.actions.SyncAction$1.run(SyncAction.java:122)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run(ModalContext.java:113)\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 -10 2005-08-25 14:38:40.177\n!MESSAGE The server reported an error while performing the \"cvs update\" command.\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 -14 2005-08-25 14:38:40.177\n!MESSAGE cfg: cvs [server aborted]: could not find desired version 1.18 in\n/cvsrep/cvsroot/OP/op/cfg/configFile.xml,v\n\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 0 2005-08-25 12:02:24.891\n!MESSAGE The server reported an error while performing the \"cvs status\" command.\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSServerException: The server\nreported an error while performing the \"cvs status\" command.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performErrorCheck(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:148)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.updateFileRevisions(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:132)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation$InternalRemoteFolderMemberFetcher.updateFileRevisions(FetchMembersOperation.java:74)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:73)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:53)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation.execute(FetchMembersOperation.java:107)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.CVSOperation.run(CVSOperation.java:79)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.model.CVSTagElement.fetchDeferredChildren(CVSTagElement.java:134)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.ui.progress.DeferredTreeContentManager$1.run(DeferredTreeContentManager.java:192)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:76)\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 -10 2005-08-25 12:02:24.891\n!MESSAGE The server reported an error while performing the \"cvs status\" command.\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 -14 2005-08-25 12:02:24.891\n!MESSAGE : cvs server: failed to create lock directory for `/cvsrep/cvsroot/OP\u0027\n(/cvsrep/cvsroot/OP/#cvs.lock): Permission denied\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 -14 2005-08-25 12:02:24.891\n!MESSAGE : cvs server: failed to obtain dir lock in repository `/cvsrep/cvsroot/OP\u0027\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 -14 2005-08-25 12:02:24.891\n!MESSAGE : cvs [server aborted]: read lock failed - giving up",
    "I think it is reasonable to assume that if you are going to delete revisions \nfrom the server that all users will be required to check out the affected \nprojects from scratch.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d26537)\nError indication due to deleted revision\n",
    "That certainly is reasonable.  However, the error handling of such an event\nleaves something to be desired.  See the attached screenshot.",
    "Yes, I agree that asn\u0027t very graceful. I have made several error handling \nimprovements in 3.2 that may have addressed this. The problem with this \nparticular case is that an improvement in the error handling would not be all \nthat helpful anyway so I\u0027m not inclined to spend time trying to reproduce the \nscenario.",
    "Actually, I tried it and was not able to reproduce the empty dialog you got \n(i.e. I always get an error message of some sort). What did you do in \nparticular to get the empty dialog?",
    "I wish I could give you more specifics, but the most specific I can get is that\nI attempted several times to Synch/Compare/Replace immediately after the\nrevision was deleted.  Unfortunately, I can\u0027t recall the exact steps.\n\nI was only lucky enough to get the empty error box once.  All the other times\nthere was no feedback.\n\nI\u0027ve attached all of the log entries that resulted from these events.  However,\nI\u0027m not sure they are very helpful.\n\nHopefully the new error handling code will help.",
