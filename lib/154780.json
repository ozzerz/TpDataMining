    "Received the following stack trace (truncated to remove non-eclipse code):\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.hierarchy.TypeHierarchy.toString(TypeHierarchy.java:1527)\n    at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.hierarchy.TypeHierarchy.toString(TypeHierarchy.java:1489)\n\nLooks like some super- or sub-types came back null and during the toString(), an NPE is thrown.\n\nI\u0027ll attach a patch for HEAD, which just involves adding a null check.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d48426)\nPatch for TypeHierarchy\n\n",
    "This is the symptom of a deeper problem and we should fix it. Jess how did you get in this situation ?",
    "Sorry, I don\u0027t have a repro, despite my attempts at such. We\u0027ve just had it reported multiple times from our eclipse-based product.",
    "(From update of attachment 48426)\nSet obsolete as we need more information (especially a test to reproduce) before knowing how we can avoid this NPE...",
    "Jess, please reopen when you\u0027ll succeed to get a reproduceable test case, thanks\n",
    "Closing as without any test case we cannot figure out what could be the best way to avoid this kind of NPE...\n"
