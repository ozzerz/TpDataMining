    "The fix has been committed to CVS.\n\nThe UUID of the Type metaclass was not preserved properly when the UML2 \nmetamodel was updated based on the new Ecore schema.\n\nWhile fixing this defect, it was discovered that the visilities of the \nelements in the metamodels (Ecore.metamodel.uml2 and UML2.metamodel.uml2) were \nincorrect; they have been corrected (change to private, as they were in UML2 \n1.0.x).\n\nAlso, the default value of Operation::isUnique (as well as Operation::lower, \nOperation::upper, and Operation::isOrdered) was unspecified in the source \nmodel, resulting in a default default value (!) which meant that values for \nthis property were being serialized unnecessarily. This has been corrected.",
    "The fix is available in build 1.1RC2."
