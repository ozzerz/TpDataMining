    "I\u0027m attaching a project with three java files.  one is an interface with the\n@model tag.  As the project stands right clicking on the Example.genmodel and\nselecting reload locates the file (It is called Example).  \n\nHowever, move either one of the two java files that are in the main project (not\npart of the build path) into the test package and the reload will no longer\nwork.  This is the case for files like the anywhere within the project.\n\nIf the enum is defined as its own class in its own file that is fine.  It only\nbreaks things when it is within another class.  The assert also breaks things. \nThis is not new.  I\u0027ve been fighting this since version 2.0.1.  I filed a bad\nbug report earlier but didn\u0027t have time to provide a good one.\n\nLet me know if this is enough information for you.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d24964)\nExample of the bug.  See the first entry of my report to make the bug manifest\n\nmove either of the java files into the test package and reloading the genmodel\nwill not work.",
    "Jesse,\n\nEMF is using JDOM and JDOM doesn\u0027t support Java 5.0 syntax.\nWe will migrate EMF to use AST as part of EMF 2.2 development:\n   https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d78076\n\nThe assert problem appears to be purely a JDOM problem:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org/eclipse/jdt/internal/core/jdom/DOMMethod\nincompatible with org/eclipse/jdt/core/jdom/IDOMType\n\tat java.lang.Throwable.\u003cinit\u003e(Throwable.java)\n\tat java.lang.Throwable.\u003cinit\u003e(Throwable.java)\n\tat java.lang.ClassCastException.\u003cinit\u003e(ClassCastException.java:54)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.jdom.DOMBuilder.createType(DOMBuilder.java:271)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.core.jdom.DOMFactory.createType(DOMFactory.java:158)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.jdom.DOMType.getDetailedNode(DOMType.java:392)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.jdom.DOMNode.becomeDetailed(DOMNode.java:390)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.jdom.DOMMember.getComment(DOMMember.java:218)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.emf.importer.java.builder.JavaEcoreBuilder.analyzeType(JavaEcoreBuilder.java:692)\n\nIt may be something the JDT folks are still willing to fix (even though JDOM is\ndeprecated).  I\u0027ll transfer this bugzilla to them for consideration.",
    "For the assert problem, there is nothing we can do.\nThe JDOM parser is using the workspace preferences. So the workaround is to\nchange the workspace compiler options to compliance 1.4 and source 1.4. We\ncannot change this without adding a new API.\n\nI will investigate the enum case.",
    "The problem comes from the fact that the JDOM API doesn\u0027t know anything about\n1.5 constructs. The API is deprecated and therefore has not been moved to 1.5\nfor the 3.1 delivery.\nDOM/AST has been provided to replace JDOM with a complete support for 1.5.\nEMF should move to DOM/AST in order to resolve this issue.\nMoving back to EMF",
    "The best we can do is to return null.",
    "Olivier,\n\nThanks for the prompt assessment!  I\u0027ll return this as a duplicate of the\nexisting bugzilla for migrating from JDOM to AST.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 78076 ***",
    "No problem.\nI will add a new bug report against JDT/Core to improve thw actual behavior on\n1.5 code. See bug 104371.",
    "The bugzilla 78076, as a plan item, was broken in 2 steps.  This bugzilla should be marked as a duplicate of 124372 which refers to enabling JMerge to work with Java5 code.",
