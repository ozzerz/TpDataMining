    "I\u0027m running eclipse 3.3M7 with a 1.5 level jdk.  In my workspace, I create a Java project (leaving the JRE at the default 1.5 level).  Then I change the project specific properties and set the compiler compliance level to 1.4.\n\nI create the following class:\n\npackage test;\npublic class MyClass {\t\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(MyClass.class.getSimpleName());\n\t}\n}\n\nNote that Class.getSimpleName() is a 1.5 method, so I expected to get some warning or error about it but I didn\u0027t get any.  And when I run this app using java 1.4 I will get an error:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.lang.Class: method getSimpleName()Ljava/lang/String; not found\n\tat test.MyClass.main(MyClass.java:6)",
    "The compiler is using the libraries on the classpath to know what methods are available. There is no clue that the getSimpleName() method exists only since 1.5.\nIf you want to run on a 1.4 VM, you better put a 1.4 library on your classpath.\nThe compliance has nothing to do with checking the methods used in the code.\nOk to close?",
    "So what exactly does the compliance level setting give me?",
    "The compliance level means that it behaves like the javac of the same level.\nSo compliance 1.5 means javac 1.5, compliance 1.4 javac 1.4, ...\nSo the compliance will set the values for the source and target platform levels.\nIt doesn\u0027t change or check the libraries on the classpath.\nIf you do the same steps with javac, you get the same error.\nfrom javac 1.5,\njavac test\\MyClass -target 1.4 -source 1.4\nand then from a 1.4 VM:\njava test.MyClass\nThis will report the same error.",
    "Thanks for clarifying the use of that setting.  Yes, OK to close.",
    "Working as designed. Closing.",
    "Closing."
