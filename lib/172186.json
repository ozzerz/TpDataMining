    "As a follow-on to bug 168762, we need Axis2 Web service runtime be supported in Web service client scenario.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d58248)\nserver side code\n\nNew attachment for the server side. \nRunning can be done exporting plugins.\nThanks",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d58249)\nclient side code\n\nNew attachment for the client side. \nRunning can be done exporting plugins.\nThanks",
    "With the above 2 zips (attachment 58248 and 58249), I\u0027m able to go through bottom-up and top-down scenario but not the client scenario.  I tried it a number of times and found that sometimes I\u0027m able to get to the Axis2 client page and sometimes not (Finish enabled but not Next).  Also, I\u0027m getting the error:\n\nException occured while file read wrote\n    java.io.FileNotFoundException: D:\\eclipse322\\eclipse\\workspace\\org.apache.axis2\\axis2\\WEB-INF\\lib (The system cannot find the path specified)\n    at java.io.FileInputStream.open(Native Method)\n    at java.io.FileInputStream.\u003cinit\u003e(FileInputStream.java:106)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.utils.ContentCopyUtils.copyDirectoryRecursivelyIntoWorkspace(ContentCopyUtils.java:80)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.command.Axis2WebservicesServerCommand.execute(Axis2WebservicesServerCommand.java:71)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d58268)\nclient code\n\nmade the earlier client code obsolete and included the corrected client code \n\nThanks",
    "I tried the client scenario with attachment 58268 in self-hosting, now the Axis2 client page comes up but when I click Finish, I got:\n\nIWAB0014E Unexpected exception occured.\n  \n      java.lang.NullPointerException\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.utils.FileUtils.deleteDirectories(FileUtils.java:69)\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.utils.FileUtils.deleteDirectories(FileUtils.java:82)\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.command.Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.execute(Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.java:61)\n\nI did a bit of debugging and found that in Axis2ClientCodegenCommand, the code is trying to locate tempCodegenOutputLocation in the \u003cworkspace\u003e/.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2\\codegen directory.  Since the code has not been generated yet, that directory does not exist and thus throws an exception.  I\u0027ve tried to manually creating that directory and the client stub does get generated OK.  I\u0027m also able to manually write a client program and successfully able to call the client stub to invoke the Web service.",
    "Just want to add that I was able to generate Axis2 client widh the workaround creating the \"codegen\" directory first when going through the Web service client wizard, if I tried to use the Web service wizard (service slider set to START and client slider set to START), I get the following error after the service side test page:\n\nException occured while code generation the wsdl\n    java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.utils.WSDL2JavaGenerator.getAxisService(WSDL2JavaGenerator.java:210)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.command.Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.execute(Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.java:67)\n\nWith some debugging, I found that the line that failed is:\n\nservice \u003d generator.getAxisService(model.getWsdlURI());\n\nmodel.getWsdlURI is null in this case.\n\nPlease remember to call WebServiceInfo.setWsdlURL() to set the WSDL URL after the Axis2 service creation extension is finish.  In Axis1, this is done in the AxisOutputCommand in the develop extension since a physical WSDL file is created in the develop phase when java2WSDL is called.  However in Axis2, since there\u0027s no physical WSDL file, you would need to use ?wsdl on the endpoint URL to get the WSDL file.  Also, this WSDL file would not be \"live\" unless the user specify START in the service slider to start the Web service on the server.",
    "As for the problem with OpenEditorCommand not bringing up the skeleton file, you should change the Axis2SkelImplCommand to something like the following:\n\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tString serviceSkeletonImplURLString \u003d  serviceSkeletonImplURLPath.toFile().toURL().toString();\n\t\t\twebServiceInfo.setImplURL(serviceSkeletonImplURLString);\n\t\t\tString[] implURLArray \u003d {serviceSkeletonImplURLString};\n\t\t\twebServiceInfo.setImplURLs( implURLArray);\n\t\t\t\n\t\t} \n\nI tested it out and the Java Editor is bringing up the skeleton file no problem with this change.  Please note that multiple skeleton file could be generated, so the code would need to set the skeleton impl URL accordingly (this could be handled later on as a defect).  The current code assumes that only 1 skeleton file would be generated.",
    "Another thing I found is if I click Finish in an Axis2 Web service skeleton scenario, I get the error:\n\nException occured while code generation the wsdl\n    java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.creation.ui.command.Axis2WSDL2JavaCommand.execute(Axis2WSDL2JavaCommand.java:89)\n\nActuall, in Axis2WSDLJavaCommand:\n\nMap optionsMap \u003d generator.fillOptionMap(\tfalse,  //async always false\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfalse,\t//sync always false\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttrue,   //is serverside true\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.isServerXMLCheck(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.isTestCaseCheck(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.isGenerateAllCheck(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.getServiceName(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.getPortName(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.getDatabindingType().toLowerCase(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.getWsdlURI(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.getPackageText(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"java\",\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttempCodegenOutputLocation,\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.getNamespaseToPackageMapping(),\n                \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmodel.isGenerateServerSideInterface());\n\nA lot of the fields in the model is null.  It seems that the Axis2DefaultingCommand has not initialize the model quite properly.  If I however click Next instead of Finish in the skeleton scenario, the scenario is able to finish successfully.  So it looks like the model info is filled in by the skeleton page only.  It should be properly defaulted in the defaulting command as well.  Remember that the wizard does not need to come up at all for the scenario to run properly.\n\nClicking Finish in an Axis2 client scenario produce similar error:\n\nException occured while code generation the wsdl\n    java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis2.consumption.ui.command.Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.execute(Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.java:76)\n\nI\u0027ve also tried the bottom-up scenario.  In that case, clicking Finish in the first page is OK.",
