    "Currently, the following three plugins depend on eclipse ui plugins:\norg.eclipse.cosmos.rm.repository\norg.eclipse.cosmos.rm.smlif\norg.eclipse.cosmos.rm.validation\n\nThese plugins need to be run outside eclipse, and should not depend on eclipse UI code.  Removing the UI dependencies will greatly help reduce the footprint of the SML MDR.",
    "SML-IF and Validation plug-ins have UI code in them.  The SML-IF plug-in contains an editor and UI-based import/export utilities.  We could possibly refactor the validation plug-in so that the menu extensions are part of the SML-IF plug-in, but we will need at least one plug-in to have Eclipse UI dependencies.",
    "Hubert, what functions from these three plugins you need to run outside of the Eclipse framework ?\nFor example, the smlif plugin contains the IF editor which is by definition an Eclipse based functionality. We need to understand your requirements before refactoring the code",
    "I was mistaken in the bug description.  I don\u0027t need to run smlif outside eclipse.  I only need to run the repository plugin outside eclipse, which depends on the validation plugin.  ",
    "Yes, I think the problem is that the repository plug-in prereqs the validation plug-in, which in turn prereqs the SMLIF plug-in.  I think it\u0027s correct that we need to make it so the repository plug-in does not prereq any plug-ins that depend on UI code, hence the need for some refactoring.",
    "David volunteered to take over this defect.\nThanks",
    "Here is the stack trace below.  It seems the code has a back up logic to load xsd from a remote URL is the local copy is not found, that logic doesn\u0027t work.  \n\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: http://www.cmdbf.org/cmdbfDataModel.xsd\n        at sun.net.www.protocol.http.HttpURLConnection.getInputStream(HttpURLCon\nnection.java:1172)\n        at java.net.URL.openStream(URL.java:1007)\n        at org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.services.provisional.common.CMDBfServices\nUtil.getCMDBfDataModel(CMDBfServicesUtil.java:251)\n        at org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.services.provisional.common.CMDBfServices\nUtil.transformImpl(CMDBfServicesUtil.java:311)\n        at org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.services.provisional.query.transform.Quer\nyInputTransformer.transform(QueryInputTransformer.java:47)\n        at org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.services.provisional.query.service.impl.C\nMDBfQueryOperation.transform(CMDBfQueryOperation.java:113)\n        at org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.cmdbf.services.provisional.query.service.impl.C\nMDBfQueryOperation.execute(CMDBfQueryOperation.java:78)\n        at org.eclipse.cosmos.dc.mdr.impl.AbstractMdr.query(AbstractMdr.java:55)\n...\n\nHere is a solution for the problem of loading the xsd from the jar file:\n\ninputStream \u003d CMDBfServicesUtil.class.getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(getDataModelXsdFileName());\n\nThe parameter of the getReousrceAsStream method is the path in the classpath.  (e.g. \"resource/cmdbfDataModel.xsd\")\nThe getPath() method turns the path separator to a backslash.  That may be the problem.  \n",
    "Please ignore comment #6.  It was meant for bug 209570. ",
    "There is concern that the related changes to the manual build cannot be contained in i7, so this will be retargeted for i8.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d83104)\npatch to remove eclipse.ui from repo plugin dependencies\n\nother related fixes have already been committed to CVS HEAD",
    "Patch applied and checked in to HEAD.  I failed to put the bug # in the commit comment, unfortunately."
