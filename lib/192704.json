    "with drop S-2.0RC3-200706140914:\n- drag a file from the project explorer into a directory of a ssh connection\n\u003d\u003e I can see visual feedback (a file icon), but nothing happenss. The visual feedback stays there when I release the mouse until I click into Remote Systems View again.\n\nHowever, dragging from the remote system to the project explorer works.\nAlso dragging a file from one remote directory to another works as well...",
    "This may be a known limitation due to the way the project explorer works. Assigning to DaveM for evaluation.",
    "how else would I get a file to a remote ssh site?",
    "What happens if you use the Navigator?",
    "With the navigator, it works just fine!\nWhat\u0027s actually the difference between the two?",
    "The project explorer is used by other plugins like CDT, therefore I think it\u0027s critical to support it....\n\nI haven\u0027t used the navigator since quite some time... one of the problems is that is does not allow to group into working sets. I\u0027m lost without that grouping -- too many projects in my workspace...",
    "Actually, dropping from project explorer should work.  Copy/paste from project explorer to RSE seems fine to me but there seems to be a bug in the RSE drop adapter.  The known limitation is in dragging and dropping from RSE to project explorer.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d71473)\nexperimental hack for dnd from project explorer\n\nHere\u0027s an experimental hack that gets resources from project explorer via drag and drop.  This isn\u0027t the right way to do it - I think we need to use common resources adapters but that requires a bit of investigation.",
    "Workaround: I guess the safest is to drag\u0026drop or copy\u0026paste from the RSE \"Local Files\" subsystem to the remote.\n\nI agree the the Project Explorer should be fixed. It\u0027s different than Resource Navigator, because PE can show any kind of contents whereas RN always shows only files -- so RN always uses FileTransfer whereas PE uses something different.",
    "Martin, did you try the patch I put here?  It may be a suitable workaround for the time-being.  ",
    "I did not look into what you described as a hack - IMHO we have time until 2.0.1 so we should come up with a proper solution.",
    "Reproduced this with RSE HEAD on both Windows and Linux. Got following NPE when dragging a folder from a project in project explorer into a folder below \"Local Files\"/My Home/aatmp. Changed summary, old value was:\n   Dropping a file from the ProjectExplorer into a sftp directory does not work\n\nThe problem seems to be that RSE detects a PluginTransfer, tries to unmarshal it and thinks it was an RSE object being dragged. But the string unmarshaled is just \"org.eclipse.ui.navigator\" which does not map to a valid profile / connection, hence the NPE when trying to access the profile.\n\nAttached patch fixes the issue, so I\u0027m applying it into RSE HEAD for now.\n\nThe NPE is as follows:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.rse.ui.internal.model.SystemRegistry.getHostPool(SystemRegistry.java:1343)\nat org.eclipse.rse.ui.internal.model.SystemRegistry.getHost(SystemRegistry.java:1530)\nat org.eclipse.rse.internal.ui.view.SystemViewDataDropAdapter.getObjectFor(SystemViewDataDropAdapter.java:260)\nat org.eclipse.rse.internal.ui.view.SystemViewDataDropAdapter.getRSESourceObjects(SystemViewDataDropAdapter.java:112)\nat org.eclipse.rse.internal.ui.view.SystemViewDataDropAdapter.getSourceObjects(SystemViewDataDropAdapter.java:127)\nat org.eclipse.rse.internal.ui.view.SystemViewDataDropAdapter.performDrop(SystemViewDataDropAdapter.java:164)\nat org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ViewerDropAdapter.drop(ViewerDropAdapter.java:233)\nat org.eclipse.swt.dnd.DNDListener.handleEvent(DNDListener.java:90)\n",
    "Patch applied:\n\n[192704] work around drag\u0026drop issues from Project Explorer\n    SystemViewDragDropAdapter.java  1.4\n\nFiled bug #200557 asking for review of the experimental hack to come up with a\nproper solution",
    "The fix is good for normal files (*.txt, ...) or simple projects.\n\nIt fails for *.c / *.h files in CDT projects. In that case, the file is simply not transferred, no error message is logged. Getting this to work is very import for our product!\n\nTo reproduce:\n* Install CDT 4.0 (Help \u003e Software Updates \u003e Find and Install \u003e New Features \u003e\n  Europa Discovery Site \u003e C/C++)\n* File \u003e New \u003e C Project\n* Accept the Defaults\n* File \u003e New \u003e Source Folder, name\u003d\"src\"\n* File \u003e New \u003e C File, name\u003d\"foo.c\"\n* Drag \u0026 Drop foo.c from project explorer into RSE System View, \n  Local Files/My Home/aatmp\n\nThe file is not transferred.",
    "Since the original NPE is no longer seen, this bug is marked fixed.\nThe CDT issue is tracked by bug 200682."
