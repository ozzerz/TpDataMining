    "Every try to run an SWT-application from within eclipse results in a thrown\nexception, see below.\n \nWhen I try to run the application via \"java -cp \u003cclasspath\u003e\n-Djava.library.path\u003dpath-to-swt.so Main\", the application runs fine. But when I\ntry either \"Run as SWT-Application\", or using \"Run ...\" and manually adding the\n\"-Djava.libray.path\u003d\" argument, I get the following exception:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no swt-pi-gtk-3136 in\njava.library.path\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1682)\n\tat java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:822)\n\tat java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:992)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.loadLibrary(Library.java:123)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.\u003cclinit\u003e(OS.java:19)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Converter.wcsToMbcs(Converter.java:63)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Converter.wcsToMbcs(Converter.java:54)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.\u003cclinit\u003e(Display.java:122)\n\tat gui.MainFrame.\u003cinit\u003e(MainFrame.java:39)\n\tat Main.main(Main.java:94)\n\nI noticed that, when I use the librarys that come with eclipse in\neclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.osgi/bundles/83/1/.cp/, java complains about\nnot beeing able to find swt-cairo-gtk-3136, although I think that is by\nintention, as I don\u0027t think eclipse uses that library. \n\nCan somebody light me up on this one? \nAh, some information: This occurs on Ubuntu 5.04, running the latest Sun JDK\n(5.0 update 3) and Eclipse (3.1RC1).",
    "Seems like 2 problems:\n\n1) Can\u0027t invoke SWT\n2) Can\u0027t find Cairo SWT library",
    "How did you put SWT in your workspace (or did you not, and just added the JAR\nfile as a dep)?",
    "(In reply to comment #2)\n\u003e How did you put SWT in your workspace (or did you not, and just added the JAR\n\u003e file as a dep)?\n\nfirst, at \"Java Build Path\" for the project, I clicked \"Add library\", there\n\"user library\", and added SWT-Library which contains the\norg.eclipse.swt_3.1.0.jar and org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.1.0.jar. \nThen, in the \"Run ...\"-dialog, I added \"-Djava.library.path\u003d\u003cpath/to/swt.so\u003e\". \nWhen I clicked \"Run\", the error happened. The same occurs when I choose \"Run as\nSWT-Application\".\n\nAs said before, manually invoking java with exactly the same\n\"-Djava.library.path\" plain works. I\u0027m happy to provide more information, as I\nreally would like to run and debug this app from within eclipse :)\n",
    "What you are doing should of course work.  Are you sure you put the\n-Djava.library.path in the VM arguments section in the Run configuration, and\nnot the program arguments section?  An easy way to tell what Eclipse is running\nis to launch using Debug, then right click on the application in the Debug view\nand select Properties.  The command line is listed there.\n\nHowever, I believe the \"Run As \u003e SWT Application\" feature was designed assuming\nyou have SWT as a project in your workspace.  You can currently import SWT into\nyour workspace using one of the following methods:\n\n 1. File \u003e Import... \u003e External Plug-Ins and Fragments \u003e Next \u003e Add SWT \u003e Finish\n 2. File \u003e Import... \u003e Existing Project into Workspace \u003e Archive File\n    Then add the .zip file of SWT from our webpage (requires RC2 + RC2 SWT .zip)\n 3. Checking out SWT from CVS at dev.eclipse.org.\n\nSince the cairo library is not used by Eclipse, it will not be extracted into\nthe configuration area.  Loading SWT into your workspace ensures that all of the\nlibraries will be there for you.",
    "Uf, now this works, thank you. \nBut strange anyways is the following:\n\nThe debug-Commandline was like the following:\n\n(I removed the -Xrunjdwp, that I can run this from a commandline)\n\n/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/bin/java\n-Djava.library.path\u003d/home/lukas/Data/Uni/SS05/GeoSoft1/e_workspace/Diekhof_Kolbe_old/\n-Xbootclasspath/a:/srv/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt_3.1.0.jar:/srv/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.1.0.jar\n-classpath /home/lukas/Data/Uni/SS05/GeoSoft1/e_workspace/Diekhof_Kolbe/bin\n-Xdebug -Xnoagent Main\n\nThis didn\u0027t work, although the right swt.so\u0027s are at\n/home/lukas/Data/Uni/SS05/GeoSoft1/e_workspace/Diekhof_Kolbe_old/.\n\nWhen I moved the swt.jars from \"-Xbootclasspath\" to \"-classpath\", as in\n-classpath\n/home/lukas/Data/Uni/SS05/GeoSoft1/e_workspace/Diekhof_Kolbe/bin:/srv/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt_3.1.0.jar:/srv/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.1.0.jar\n\nIt suddenly worked. Now, after I imported SWT into my workspace, the commandline\n\"Debug as SWT Application\" uses is this:\n\n/usr/lib/j2sdk1.5-sun/bin/java\n-Djava.library.path\u003d/home/lukas/Data/Uni/SS05/GeoSoft1/e_workspace/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86\n-classpath\n/home/lukas/Data/Uni/SS05/GeoSoft1/e_workspace/Diekhof_Kolbe/bin:/srv/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.1.0.jar:/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86:/srv/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.1.0.jar\n-Xdebug -Xnoagent\n-Xrunjdwp:transport\u003ddt_socket,suspend\u003dy,address\u003dlocalhost:32957 Main\n\n... no -Xbootclasspath anymore, and everything works.\nThanks anyway for pointing out the \"right way\" to import SWT into the workspace.",
    "You need to make sure you have the .so files that correspond to the version of\nthe .jar files you have.  Each release of SWT changes the version of the .so\nfiles it requires.  Maybe this is what went wrong?",
    "I think you were overriding the java.library.path from the SWT launcher.  Since\nthings work for you now, I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any point in keeping this bug\nopen.  I am closing this as WORKSFORME.\n\nPlease re-open if you are still having trouble.",
    "Sorry for my inactivity, RL came in between. This bug can of course be closed\nnow. There is no \"Run as SWT-Application\" anymore, and it\u0027s easy to attach a\nnative library to a given .jar w/o having to modify java.library.path, and it\nactually works like a charm.\n\nThanks for your support!",
    "(Actually, \"Run As \u003e SWT Application\" was added back in for 3.1 final)  ;)"
