    "Can you provide me with some detailed repro steps? Did you have history linking on when you tried to check the project out? How exactly did you check out the project?",
    "The NPE occured when I checked out the project org.eclipse.birt.report.designer.ui from dev.eclipse.org:/home/birt with CVS Repositories View in the CVS Repositories Exploring perspective.\nI just deleted the project and then checked out it to update all the codes.\nMy CVS History View is set to link with the Editor and show remote revisions only.\nIt\u0027s a rare case. The error doesn\u0027t reproduce any more after occured twice.",
    "I wasn\u0027t able to reproduce this, but the code looks like it could do with some null checks as obviously there is a path out there that can cause your scenario.",
    "Added a NPE check."
