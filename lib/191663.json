    "Please try to update Mylar again making sure that you got all components by using Software Updates -\u003e Search for new features... instead of \"search for updates\".  Let us know if that resolves it.\n\nThis could be a duplicate of bug 191692.",
    "I\u0027m running 3.3RC2; if I search on the normal Europa sites I just see the \u0027Trac\u0027 connector for Mylar.  Do I need a specific update site for Mylar?",
    "If you run the search and see that JIRA is installed this is likely another problem.  \n\nRichard: I assume that you\u0027re using the Europa-based install of Mylar?\n\nEugene: have you seen this before?  That class should be coming from the xmlrpc libraries, so I wonder if there is some conflict in another library coming from Europa.",
    "Yes, I installed everything from Europa when I set up 3.3RC2.  However today I did an update of everything, after which the Mylar Jira connector stopped working.  Maybe I have got some components intended for 3.3RC3 or RC4.  \n\nI uninstalled Mylar from the \u0027Manage Configuration\u0027 window; but I see the mylar plugin jars are still in the plugins directory.\n\nCould be some unrepeatable update mess; I\u0027ll probably start again with a clean RC4 and see what happens.\n\nI did notice that the manifest in the Jira plugin contains:\n\nBundle-ClassPath: .,lib-axis/axis-1.3.jar,lib-axis/commons-discovery-0\n .2.jar,lib-axis/jaxrpc.jar,lib-axis/saaj.jar,lib-axis/wsdl4j-1.5.1.ja\n r\n\nAfter the update this morning, there is no lib-axis in my eclipse/configuration directory; lib-axis was in the previous version that I used heavily (3.3M7).  \n\nMaybe one of the recent updates has disposed of lib-axis.\n",
    "(In reply to comment #4)\n\u003e Yes, I installed everything from Europa when I set up 3.3RC2.  \n\u003e However today I did an update of everything, after which the Mylar Jira\n\u003e connector stopped working.

    "I was able to reproduce this without any other Europa plug-ins installed, so marking as a duplciate of bug 191692.  Not yet sure what changes in the JIRA connector or packaging could have caused this.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 191692 ***"
