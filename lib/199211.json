    "Build ID: I20070625-1500\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. Install Eclipse 3.3, EMF 2.3, ATL 2.0.0rc2\n2. Run the following skeleton code:\n\nimport ... ;\n\nEMFModelLoader ml;\nAtlModelHandler amh \u003d AtlModelHandler.getDefault(\"EMF\");\n\nASMEMFModel metaModel \u003d (ASMEMFModel)((AtlEMFModelHandler)amh).loadModel(String metaid, amh.getMof(), new FileInputStream(String metapath));\n\nByteArrayOutputStream outModel \u003d new ByteArrayOutputStream();\nASMEMFModel OUT \u003d ASMEMFModel.newASMEMFModel(\"OUT\", \"OUT\", metaModel, ml);\nOUT.setCheckSameModel(false);\n\nAtlLauncher myLauncher \u003d AtlLauncher.getDefault();\nmyLauncher.launch(URL trans, HashMap\u003cString, URL\u003elibs, HashMap\u003cString, ASMEMFModel\u003emodels_including_OUT, Collections.EMPTY_MAP, Collections.EMPTY_LIST, Collections.EMPTY_MAP);\n\namh.saveModel(OUT, outModel); // crashline\n\nThis results in:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.m2m.atl.engine.AtlEMFModelHandler.saveModel(AtlEMFModelHandler.java:144)\nat org.eclipse.m2m.atl.engine.AtlEMFModelHandler.saveModel(AtlEMFModelHandler.java:65)\nat crashline\n\n\n\n\nMore information:\nReplacing the second string \"OUT\" in the call to saveModel by an empty string or null doesn\u0027t help.",
    "There was a problem in AtlEMFModelHandler, which tried to setDerived even if no URI was provided.\n\nThis should now be solved on CVS HEAD.\n\nCan you please confirm?\n\nThanks.\n\nFr?d?ric",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e There was a problem in AtlEMFModelHandler, which tried to setDerived even if no\n\u003e URI was provided.\n\u003e \n\u003e This should now be solved on CVS HEAD.\n\u003e \n\u003e Can you please confirm?\n\u003e \nI would like to, but I can\u0027t get the ATL checked out from CVS to build.  It seems like the build paths somehow aren\u0027t correctly specified?\n\nI did:\n1. check out ATL from CVS as described  in http://wiki.eclipse.org/ATL/How_Install_ATL_From_CVS/\nThis went OK.\n\n2. change to plug-in perspective and convert the project to a plug-in project.\nThis went OK.\n\n3. From the context menu: Export-\u003ePlug-in Development-\u003eDeployable plug-ins and fragments.\nThis fails with a lot of unresolved import errors.  I\u0027ve placed the log file at http://home.tiscali.nl/rladan/logs.zip (121 kB zipped, 2.18 MB unzipped)\n\nI started adding all the build path dependencies manually, but that kept me ready for at least half an hour, so I guessed there must be another way to build it.",
