    "Steps:\n1.I created a new plugin in the existing library - no errors.\n2.Then I created a new configuration,there is prompt for entering name. I entered name and clicked ok. There is error which says to check the log.\n3.Following is part of log:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.epf.authoring.ui.forms.ConfigurationPage$ConfigPackageLabelProvider.getText(ConfigurationPage.java:1203)",
    "After reloading the library, I can see the new configuration but when I click on the tab \u0027plugin and package selection\u0027, there is error dlg and can\u0027t get rid of it. I have to kill the application.",
    "Pls investigate asap.",
    "Ultra Edit is adding extra/illegal characters and hence there is exception.",
    "We couldn\u0027t load the process for certain packages. These packages probably been edited by UltraEdit which added certain chars in the beginning of those XMI files. Sun JRE parser couldn\u0027t load those XMI files but IBM JRE could. Phong has to deliver this fix in persistence code to strip-off those characters.\n\nFixed NullPointerException in UI by showing processComponent name (most likely it will show as blank) if process is not loaded correctly.",
    "Works fine now. Verified in build M3-N20060530",
    "verified, closed."
