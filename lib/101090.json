    "When I RC-\u003eRun as-\u003eAnt Build, no stdout or stderr gets written to console.  If I\nrun using same jvm, output shows up just fine.\n\nDuplicated on a stock 3.1RC3 install with no third party plugins or ~/.eclipse\ndir on linux FC4 using j2sdk1.4.2_07.",
    "Forgot the stack trace:\n\njava.net.SocketTimeoutException: Accept timed out\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketAccept(Native Method)\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.accept(PlainSocketImpl.java:353)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.implAccept(ServerSocket.java:448)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.accept(ServerSocket.java:419)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.RemoteAntBuildListener$ServerConnection.run(RemoteAntBuildListener.java:97)\n",
    "So this is for all Ant builds?\nHave Ant builds worked on this machine before (previous to Rc3)?\nIs there something getting in the way of the socket communication?\n\nThis exception indicates that more than 10 seconds is passing for the \ncommunication to be set up between the Eclipse listener and the remote Ant \nbuild.\n\n",
    "Yes, this happens for any ant build.\nHowever, other java processes are having socket connection problems, so I\u0027m\nstarting to think it might be a FC4/jdk issue rather than eclipse.\nI\u0027ll see if can track it down some more.",
    "This turned out to be a FC4/jdk 1.4 issue.\nDisabling IPV6 in FC4 solved the problem:\n\n/etc/modprobe.conf:\nalias net-pf-10 off\n",
    "FC4/jdk 1.4/ipv6 issue",
    "I get this problem inconsistently on my plaform.\nIt happens on every 3rd or 4th run if (I strongly suspect after observing for a while now) Java is gc-ing or xp is swapping - time is lost and \"accept times out\" (We have browser,fire wall,virus checker and other bits also running)\n\nLoosing the output is very frustrating. Is it possible to change this time out value via some config file in 3.2M4? Can we increase it to 30-60 or \"preference set\" it in future releases ? Please help.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\nCheers and goodwill\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nConfiguration\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntel Pentium III 448Mhz, 320 MB of RAM\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWindows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600.xpsp_sp2_gdr.050301-1519: Service Pack 2)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\njava version \"1.5.0_06\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode, sharing)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\neclipse-platform-3.2M4-win32\neclipse-PDE-3.2M4\neclipse-JDT-3.2M4\nxsd-runtime-2.2.0M3\nemf-sdo-runtime-2.2.0M3\nGEF-runtime-3.2M3\nJEM-runtime-I20051130\nwtp-1.0RC5\nsubclipse-0.9.37\n-----------------------------------------------------------",
    "Thank you for the report.\nReopening to consider exposing the timeout as a preference.",
    "Timeout exposed as a preference on the Ant preference page.\n\nChanges to\nAntUIPreferenceInitializer to set the preference default value\nIAntUIPreferenceConstants to define the preference\nRemoteAntBuildListener: removed debug code and uses the preference value for the socket timeout\nAntPreferencePage: added the integer field editor for the preference\nAntPreferenceMessages files: nlsing for the preference page",
    "Please verify Kevin.",
    "verified.\nUpdated error message to include upper bound as well as the lower bound of timeout preference. If you entered a timeout greater that Integer.MaxInt it told you that timeout had to be greater than 10000. ",
    "hmmm...I am not sure I like the error message. I agree it needed tweaking but showing the 2 billion plus milliseconds looks weird. I will see how I feel tomorrow.\n\nI also bumped up the default to 20 seconds (same as the debug launch timeout)",
    "I agree. I just wasn\u0027t sure what a reasonable upper bound for the timeout was. MaxInt is too long.",
    "Upper bound of 5 min should be sufficient. If it can\u0027t make it in that time then we need a machine upgrade ( definitely in our case ) or there is some other problem that needs investigation.",
    "I think if we double it and move to 10 mins no one should complain.\n\nThe debug preference pages have the same issue.",
    "Set the max to 20 mins.",
    "Verified."
