    "This was working a couple months ago, but in recent builds it\u0027s not. If required, I can probably remove all my internal content from my plug-in so you have an example to work from.\n\nI\u0027ve written a plug-in that contributes to the UI and integrates with the help system by doing the following:\n\n        PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getHelpSystem()\n            .setHelp(parent, \"myHelpID\");\n\nI\u0027m getting the following NPE:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.help.search.LuceneSearchParticipant.resolveVariables(LuceneSearchParticipant.java:148)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.cheatsheets.CheatsheetSearchParticipant.getAllDocuments(CheatsheetSearchParticipant.java:53)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.search.IndexingOperation.getAddedDocuments(IndexingOperation.java:401)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.search.IndexingOperation.execute(IndexingOperation.java:83)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.search.SearchManager.updateIndex(SearchManager.java:871)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.search.SearchManager.ensureIndexUpdated(SearchManager.java:835)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.search.SearchManager.search(SearchManager.java:602)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.views.DynamicHelpPart.performSearch(DynamicHelpPart.java:265)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.views.DynamicHelpPart.access$5(DynamicHelpPart.java:259)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.ui.internal.views.DynamicHelpPart$3.run(DynamicHelpPart.java:248)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)",
    "Actually the exception you\u0027re getting seems unrelated to what you\u0027re doing. See bug 148056 for this one. As for the context help not working, you need to specify the full ID including the plugin here - so something like com.my.plugin.myHelpId.\n\nCan you confirm this was the problem?",
    "This might be the same issue as 148056. My project has not moved from 3.2 to 3.2.1 yet, so I can\u0027t verify it\u0027s fixed for a few weeks yet. The id I used in my example was just a place holder. In my real plug-in the id is fully qualified as you describe. I changed it here after I pasted in the code to avoid getting my hand slapped by the legal team.\n\nI guess since this has been fixed in 3.2.1 that this defect can be closed. Once we make the move to that stream if it\u0027s not fixed I can always reopen this defect.",
    "Just to clarify, the problem you\u0027re describing, or at least implying (context help doesn\u0027t work) is unrelated to the stack trace. You should still get that stack trace even if you don\u0027t use context help at all. Fixing bug 148056 won\u0027t do anything to context help, it just fixes the unrelated stack trace.\n\nIs it really the case that you cannot get context help to show up for your UI or were you just assuming that since you saw a stack trace it wouldn\u0027t work? I think I may be missing something here.",
    "Here\u0027s what happens:\n\n1) The user opens my UI and presses F1 to open the help.\n2) A dialog opens with a bunch of error messages in the help indexer and the dynamic help search. (I will attach a file with the dialog so you can see it)\n3) The help content is displayed.\n\nThe issue isn\u0027t that the help is not displayed. It\u0027s that everytime the user goes to the help they will see this error dialog that says there were errors related to the help.\n\nIf the other bug you mentioned has been fixed in 3.2.1, this dialog will probably not come up and everything will be fine.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d46383)\nScreen cap of error dialog\n\n",
    "Now I understand. You\u0027re right, with the fix to the other bug it will suppress the error message and just send the stack trace to the log instead, so you won\u0027t see it. However that\u0027s not the end of it.. the bug was to handle errors more gracefully, meaning that there\u0027s still a problem in one of your product\u0027s cheat sheets. It\u0027s in the extension where you specify the path to the XML file for the cheat sheet. I recall debugging one earlier where it was using windows slashes and on Linux it would cause the same problem as you\u0027re seeing (which is why that bug is open). I was working with Susan Yeshin on this one so if you\u0027re on the same product/team you can ask her if it\u0027s the same one she was seeing. If not, then you can open a bug on your product.\n\nI\u0027m closing this one since we\u0027ve done all we can on the issue in 3.2.1 (and we can\u0027t change 3.2).\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 148056 ***"
