    "When moving through the Events of a test log using the Next (right arrow) button in the Test Log viewer, the customer eventually gets: \n\n     An error had occurred.  See error log for more details. \n\nand the Error Log reports:\n\n   Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in:  \"/org.eclipse.jface\".  \n\n   Exception Stack Trace: \n   java.lang.NullPointerException at\n   org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui.forms.base.ExecutionEventDetailsPart\n   .setInput(ExecutionEventDetailsPart.java:643) \n   at org.eclipse.hyades.test.ui.forms.base.TypedEventDetailsPart\n   .setInput(TypedEventDetailsPart.java:65) \n             ...\n\nTo reproduce the problem with the attached log (will attach as soon as I figure out how :-):\n1. Import the attached project and display the Test Log of the \"login\" entry in the Performance Test Runs.\n2. Go to the Events and expand User Group 1 and [User Group 1][000001].\n3. Expand the SearchViewbyLOB, \"test execution\", and SearchViewbyLOB.\n4. About 19 lines into this you\u0027ll see \"Loop (2 iterations)[2]\".  Expand this and then expand the seond entry in the loop (\"[] (131560)\"). \n5. Click on the final entry in this - \"Destroy Window [][](131560)\".\n6. Repeatedly click on the Navigate to Next button (right arrow) at the top right of the Test Log.  After 22-25 clicks, the error dialog will appear.\n\nThis is reproducible each time and on separate installations.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d62007)\nTest Log with the failure during navigation\n\nThis is the test log that your may use to reproduce this defect. Please follow the directions in the original defect description.",
    "I think Bianca would be the right person for this defect.",
    "Ashish, in which version of TPTP is this defect found?",
    "Assuming defect found in TPTP 4.4.",
    "Ashish, I couldn\u0027t reproduce it with your log file on the current 4.4 builds. So close as WORKSFORME for now.",
    "Reporter: Please verify and close in preparation for shutting down the TPTP 4.4 release.  Thanks."
