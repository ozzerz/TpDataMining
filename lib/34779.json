    "Can you run the compiler successfully from the command-line and not from ant \nand compile one of the example applications?  I haven\u0027t seen this error \nreported before, but it does look like a detailed configuration issue.  I\u0027d\nrecommend that you try working from the command-line with a small example so \nthat you can examine exactly what\u0027s on your classpath.\n\nI\u0027d also suggest that you try the latest version of the compiler.  1.1rc1 \nshould be out in the next couple of days.\n\nIf none of this works, then we\u0027ll want to bring this up on the aspectj-dev \nmailing list.  This appears to be an OS X configuration issue and while the \ncore committers to AspectJ work on Windows/Linux, I know that a number of \npeople on the aspectj-dev list work with AspectJ on OS X quite effectively.",
    "This bug should be fixed in the current cvs tree.  The fix was to move AspectJ \nto the eclipse 2.1 code base rather than 2.0 where they had already fixed this \nerror.\n\nNote: I don\u0027t have access to a Mac so this fix is unverified.",
    "*** Bug 37504 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "I have Eclipse 2.1 and aspectj 1.1 rc2 and still get this error with every compile. i tried the ajc \ncommand line tool and the ant tasks. so i cannot get aspectj to work at all ?!\n\ni have osx 10.2.6 and java 1.4.1.",
    "i am awfully sorry folks, i had rc1.....",
    "This is fixed in rc2, the reopening was a mistake, see comments below."
