    "Build ID: I20070323-1616\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. Hit \"Open Type\"\n2. Start typing in a type\n3. Gets Stuck at \"Searching... (40%)\n4. If I hit enter at this point, takes me to wrong types\n\n\nMore information:\nStarted failing with M6.",
    "After blowing away eclipse directory and starting again,\nproblem went away.\n\nHowever, problem had not gone away after starting with eclipse -clean.\n\nSo problem sounds unreproducible at this time.\n",
    "I have the same problem while running the 3.3 M6 build on WinXP. \nGoing back to M5eh resolves the issue.\nAlso finding references to a method would hang.\n\nThe first time after starting the image the Open Type dialog would show the \"Initializing search indices\"  status message and count down to the number of files left to index. Usually the first search also works.\n\nI did get an error once when the \"Initializing search indices\" hung with 10 files left with a dialog box saying\" An internal error occurred during: \"Progress message refresh\"\n\nThe error log contained the following exception:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.ui.progress.UIJob.run(UIJob.java:76)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\n\nThe strange thing is I was using the M6 build on two different workspaces using different cvs code streams (Prod and Dev).\n\nThe problem would occur for me only on the Dev workspace consistently.\n\nI tried nuking the .metadata directory on the Dev workspace and restarting it but that did not solve the problem.\n\n/sanjay\n",
    "Similarly, with 3.3M6, sometimes when I attempt to refresh the workspace from within the Java Package Explorer (right click on project, and choose Refresh), the Refresh hangs at 99% and the same exception appears in the log.\n\nI need to kill Eclipse and restart it to recover.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2007-04-12 11:47:27.604\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Progress message refresh\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.progress.UIJob.run(UIJob.java:76)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\nMachine / Eclipse information:\n!SESSION 2007-04-12 12:04:13.255 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dI20070323-1616\njava.version\u003d1.5.0_11\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nFramework arguments:  -startup C:\\Dev\\Tools\\app\\eclipse3_3M6\\eclipse\\eclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.0.v20070319.jar -showlocation\nCommand-line arguments:  -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -startup C:\\Dev\\Tools\\app\\eclipse3_3M6\\eclipse\\eclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.0.0.v20070319.jar -showlocation -data c:\\nms_build_root\\eclipse_ws\n\n\n",
    "The NPE is bug 170890, which has been fixed shortly after 3.3 M6. The affected job is the Open Type dialog\u0027s UI update job, which explains the wrong selections and broken progress.\n\nI could not reproduce these problems with I20070410-1043 any more, so I\u0027ll close this bug. Please reopen if you see this in a later build."
