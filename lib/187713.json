    "There seems to be a problem with the filter naming here such that we\u0027re not able to match a filter with the name we have.",
    "I\u0027ve tried to implement some code in the getFilterReferenceWithAbsoluteName(String key) method to take the proper string to work with prior to processing.  My solution works, Although an issue arises if the Filter were to have any \".\" or \":\" characters, which is currently being allowed to the user.  Basic idea below\n\nString key \u003d \n\nkevin.Local.interface org.eclipse.rse.services.files.IFileService.kevin.kevin:local.files.a\n\nand after executing some string methods we have something easier to work with in order to return the proper information, initial code was attempting to get the below information from the string above and is failing:\n\nkevin.kevin:local.files.a\n\nSystemFilterPoolManager : kevin\nfilterPoolName : kevin:local.files\nfilterName : a\n\n\n\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d70525)\nsolution for getFilterReferenceWithAbsoluteName method to return proper filter reference\n\nI have come with a workaround with the issue I stated above.  The correct filter reference is now being returned by the getFilterReferenceWithAbsoluteName method.  The filters can be now moved to the scratchpad.  The patch has resolved the defect. \n\nAlthough, there is another issue that is present (NPE) that only occurs sometimes when the filter is moved above or below itself.  This NPE is occuring in the  SystemDNDTransferRunnable.java class and I will take a look to see if I can resolve the issue now.\n\nStack from log:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2007-06-07 11:59:55.369\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Transfer Operation\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.rse.internal.ui.view.SystemDNDTransferRunnable.transferRSEResources(SystemDNDTransferRunnable.java:247)\n\tat org.eclipse.rse.internal.ui.view.SystemDNDTransferRunnable.runInWorkspace(SystemDNDTransferRunnable.java:575)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.InternalWorkspaceJob.run(InternalWorkspaceJob.java:38)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)",

    "The second patch looks good.  \n\nThe thing I\u0027m worried about with the first patch is that it assumes a naming convention based on the signature of the service interface and this is likely to change.  We\u0027re going to have think about this a bit more.",
    "I\u0027d like to apply the second patch for RC3 but defer the first issue for later.   Martin, what do you think?",
    "Martin is not around.  Dave I want to know whether you think we should apply the second patch for this or not for RC3.",
    "Moving this to 2.0.1 for now.",
