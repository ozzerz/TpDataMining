    "I tried to create a new Task in my JIRA repository with Mylyn + JIRA connector. First I got a  message \"could not create ticket\". I couldn\u0027t find anything on the internet about this error message, so I tried to change the JIRA connector configuration, enabling HTTP authentication - just for a try. But then I got this null pointer exception.\n\n-- Error Log --\nDate: Fri Sep 14 12:42:49 CEST 2007\nMessage: no message\nSeverity: Error\nPlugin ID: org.eclipse.mylyn\nStack Trace:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.core.service.web.JiraWebIssueService$9.execute(JiraWebIssueService.java:553)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.core.service.web.JiraWebSession.doInSession(JiraWebSession.java:56)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.core.service.web.JiraWebIssueService.createIssue(JiraWebIssueService.java:543)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.core.service.soap.JiraRpcClient.createIssue(JiraRpcClient.java:282)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.ui.JiraTaskDataHandler.postTaskData(JiraTaskDataHandler.java:525)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.editors.AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor$37.run(AbstractRepositoryTaskEditor.java:2754)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)",

    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e The error above is most likely caused by missing attributes which was fixed\n\u003e recently.

But, I still get the \"Could not create ticket\" message. I guess that\u0027s because we have custom (mandatory) attributes in our JIRA. I read something about that on the Eclipsepedia  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Jira_Connector\n\n\n",
    "Steffen: do you know our current support (or lack thereof) for custom/mandatory attributes?",
    "Thomas, could you give an example of a custom attribute that needs to be specified during issue creation? Are those attributes displayed in the Mylyn task editor?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d80737)\nScreen shot of new of new issue in eclipse\n\nThis screen shot shows how the dialog looks when I create a new of new issue in eclipse. Custom attributes are not shown. Some of the custom attributes are also mandatory.\nCompare this to the other screen shot of how the creat dialog looks when I create a new issue in the browser.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d80738)\nScreen shot of new issue in browser\n\nThis screen shot shows how the dialog looks when I create a new of new issue in a browser. You can see some custom attributes. Some of the custom attributes are also mandatory.\nCompare this to the other screen shot of how the create dialog looks when I create a new issue in eclipse.",
    "Thanks Thomas. It seems that Mylyn parses information about custom fields from the RSS which does not work for creating new issues. The JiraSoapService offers a getCustomFields() method that should be in that case. I\u0027ll investigate that for the next release if time permits.",
    "Steffen, getCustomFields() call offers much less information about custom fields that is available in RSS. Basically it only give field ids. We either have to cache information about fields collected from issues or rpc api need to be extended to provide complete information about field names, types and available options. The latter also not available in the rss feed. See current limitations section for jira connector on the wiki.",
    "Okay, we\u0027ll need to file a feature request against JIRA to improve the customs field support in the SOAP API."
