    "See attached screen capture.  Note that none of the existing java projects have CVS connections, and \nthe \"Team Share\" perspective has no entries.\n\nAfter creating the \"abbot\" project I did establish a CVS connection but later disconnected it (via Team-\n\u003eDisconnect context menu).  The connection was to sourceforge (abbot.sf.net), using :ext: connections \nboth with /usr/bin/ssh and extssh mapped to the :ext: protocol (neither ended up working \nsatisfactorily, but that\u0027s a different bug).\n\nNow during every launch/build, the dialog appears with one or more of the displayed error in it.",

    "Could you please attach the error log file (the .log file found in \nthe .metadata directory of your workspace)? \n\nThe error is not the result of an attempted connection. It is a processing \nerror mot likely related to the Synchronize view. The error log will hopefully \nhave more details about the error.",

    "Here\u0027s the CVS error. Have you modified your install in any way? This type of \nerror should be caught by the compiler. However, the CVS code compiles fine \nwhich means it is most likely a VM issue.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Apr 09, 2005 12:12:41.532\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Reconciling CVS state changes\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.AbstractMethodError: \norg.eclipse.team.internal.core.BackgroundEventHandler.dispatchEvents\n(Lorg/eclipse/core/runtime/IProgressMonitor;)V\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.BackgroundEventHandler.processEvents\n(BackgroundEventHandler.java:278)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.BackgroundEventHandler$1.run\n(BackgroundEventHandler.java:131)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66)\n\n",
    "There are really two issues here: The first is the error itself. As I said, \nthis appears to be a VM issue and there is not much I can do about that. The \nsecond is that CVS operations are running on disconnected projects. This is \nprobably a side effect of auto-connection (or reconnection in this case). I \nhave added a preference to disable auto-sharing (and I\u0027m marking this bu fixed \nto reflect that).",
    "The only mods I would have made would have been to use the software update utility (probably to go \nfrom 3.0.1 to 3.0.2, but I can\u0027t be certain).  java reports the following:\n\njava version \"1.4.2_05\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_05-141.4)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-38, mixed mode)\n"
