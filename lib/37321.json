    "After installing 2.1.1, starting an existing workspace led to this error:\n\n!SESSION\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 May 07, 2003 10:26:27.543\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at\nsun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:61)\n        at\nsun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:40)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:335)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:291)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:747)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:583)\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Fatal Error: Unable to locate\nmatching org.eclipse.core.runtime plug-in.\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.PlatformConfiguration.locateDefaultPlugins(PlatformConfiguration.java:2264)\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.PlatformConfiguration.\u003cinit\u003e(PlatformConfiguration.java:903)\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.PlatformConfiguration.startup(PlatformConfiguration.java:1368)\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.initialize(InternalBootLoader.java:582)\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.startup(InternalBootLoader.java:1006)\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.run(InternalBootLoader.java:838)\n        at org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader.run(BootLoader.java:461)\n        ... 7 more\n\nEclipse doesn\u0027t start anymore.

    "There is a similar bugreport for the debian packages (2.1 with the patch from \nbug #36101). Unfortunatelly the whole .metatdata dir was removed shortly after \nthis bugrepiort, so I can\u0027t say, what the proble was :(",
    "The problem occured for me on WindowsXP. So I believe it is not platform \nspecific.",
    "AFAICS, the problem appears if someone defines a new update site (in the \nInstall/Update Perspective) prior to the upgrade to the new version (2.1.1). That was \nmy case.  ",
    "I\u0027m pretty sure, that this sin\u0027t the case. The mentioned exception is thrown \nbefore any plugin is actually loaded, so I don\u0027t think that update has had a \nchance to choke on something. IMO, this can happen becasue of two reasons:\n\n* The plugin specified in boot.xml is spelled wrong or simple not there.\n* the plugin wasn\u0027t found in any of the sites\n\nIn the case of the debian packages (the error goes away after deleting .\nmetadata) it\u0027s not the first one.\n\nThats at least my guess after having a closer look into PlatformConfiguration.\njava",
    "As far as I know core and update have not yet released any code in the 2.1.1.\nstream. Moving to update for further investigation, as this occurs while\nprocessing the configuration and goes away if the configuration is deleted.",
    "The problem which the debian user reported was happening with RC1 and final \nversion. Unfortunatelly she deleted the whole .metadata dir. \n\nhttp://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive\u003dno\u0026bug\u003d192176",
    "See also bug #31437",
    "This error is thrown when there is a mismatch between the core.boot,\ncore.runtime and xerces\n\nStartup goes through a complex algoright to find the bext core.boot, then look\nfor the boot.xml file to get the best associated runtime and then look into\nruntime to find the xerces\n\nStart with -debug it will tell you which Boot is found, look for the boot.xml it\nwill tell you which runtime is the best... now, the platform.cfg may state this\nruntime should not be loaded, in which case update will look at it\n\nI haven\u0027t downloaded 2.1.1, but in general we change the version # of boot in\nits plugin.cml to notify the update/reconciler a new version of eclipse has been\ninstalled. During this reconciliatio, we compute the \u0027best core, runtime and\nxerces\u0027. We also may have an issue in the recomputation if eclipse 2.1.1 was\ninstalled in the same directory or another\n\nnow that I *tried* to explain, do we have a pattern here ? (different location\nof install, same ?)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d4850)\nplatform.cfg leading to tthis error\n",
    "I will attach the platform.cfg of the debian user. I think this is related to \nthe \u0027policy\u003dUSER-EXCLUDE\u0027 and list.0\u003d[...],plugins/org.eclipse.core.boot_2.1\n.0/plugin.xml,[...] ",
    "I will attach the platform.cfg of the debian user. I think this is related to \nthe \u0027policy\u003dUSER-EXCLUDE\u0027 and list.0\u003d[...],plugins/org.eclipse.core.boot_2.1\n.0/plugin.xml,[...] \n\nPutting this into my platform.cfg I get the same error. Good hunting :)",
    "I can see we disabled everything (all the features)\nOlivier, did we create new fetaures for 2.1.1 ? if so did we bump the version of\ncore ? (AFAI can see, core is still 2.1.0 no )",
    "I don\u0027t think that has anything to do with that. The two cases I know of happend \non 2.1.0 versions, one with \u0027debian only\u0027 (first debian version in sid was RC3) \nand the other one with RC1 (normal drop in /usr/local/) and latest debian \n(2.1-4, which is basicly the 2.1 release recompiled from source on debian).",
    "My test case was quite simple.\nI used the same workspace for months. It worked great when I ran it with \nEclipse 2.1 build. When I wanted to switch to the first maintenance build \n2.1.1, I could not restart it without deleting the .config folder. Once it is \ndeleted, it can restart. So there is something wrong with the .config contents, \nbut the worse problem is that the error dialog is not helpful.",
    "Do you use links/*.links files? The debian packages provide such a file which \nwas changed from \"path\u003dusr/local/\" to \"path\u003dr /usr/local/lib\" (see bug #36101 \nfor information why the \u0027r \u0027...).",
    "Ok , I will check the 2.1.1 drop\n\nMy point with feature is that, if we create new feature the reconciler will\ndisable them upon first restart. So if new 2.1.1 feature are created, and point\nto the 2.1.0 core, we will disable core 2.1.0. \n\nthe platform.cfg is a result of the reconciliation and is indeed the cause of\nteh \u0027not found\u0027 \n \nJust wanted to know if there was 2.1.1 features when you installed 2.1.1\nAs I said, I will check into it, delete .config to start properly\n\n",
    "Should we close it or is it still happening ?",
    "I do not think it is fixed, since I just saw this bug using build 200310221400 \nof 2.1.2. I installed it into the directory where 2.1 had been installed and \ntried pointing it at my existing workspace.",
    "I simply removed platform.cfg and restarted. It regenerated a new one and all is\nwell. Try it for an easy fix. (save it if it messes you up more.)",
    "This bug is no longer valid in 3.0, as the config data is no longer located in \nthe workspace."
