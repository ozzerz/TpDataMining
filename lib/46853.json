    "i am using Win XP, JDK 1.4.\neclipse version 2.1.2\nBuild id: 200311030802\n\nI can\u0027t reproduce it because it just happen sometimes, not all the time. (I \ndon\u0027t know why)\n\nWhat I did is running the visitor in a BIG project.\n\n",
    "What VM? Some VMs are known to have JIT problems that are causing NPE.\nIf you get it consistently, try to start your VM with a vm argument.\nUse the -vmargs as the last argument on your command line and put:\n-vmargs -Djava.compiler\u003dNONE\n\nWithout steps to reproduce, it is almost impossible to track it down. Looking at\nthe code I don\u0027t see how it is possible to get null for the methods of a binding.\nI really think this is a JIT issue.",
