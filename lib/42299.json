    "When I switch from version 2.1 to 3.0 M1 (M2 and M3 as well), two of my \nprojects stopped running from within Eclipse.  Versiosn 2.1 and 2.1.1 still \nwork fine however.\n\nThis is the error I\u0027m getting, and it\u0027s got something to do with static \ninitialization, I think.  Seems like the order that things are initialized \nmight be different (why I can\u0027t fathom).  Error message when executing:\n\n\u003c\u003c\u003c\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Class not found in enumLookup class \ncom.aaw.common.enum.ProductType\nat com.aaw.common.enum.infrastructure.EnumBean.getEnums(EnumBean.java:77)\nat com.aaw.producttool.ProductTool.main(ProductTool.java:23)\nException in thread \"main\" \n\u003e\u003e\u003e\n\nI can\u0027t pinpoint the problem exactly.  I stripped down my two projects to the \nsmallest set of code I could find that still reproduced the problem (and also \nwork using 2.1.1).  I\u0027ve placed a zip on a public server containing the two \nprojects, as well as my preferences file.\n\nThe file can be found at: http://www.slac.com/cnelson/eclipse-bug.zip\n\nThere are two projects, one called aaw_common and another called \naaw_product_tool (which depends on aaw_common).  In the top-level of \naaw_product_tool, my preferences and config details for 2.1.1 and 3.0 M3 can be \nfound.\n\nPlease let me know what I can do to help with this... I\u0027m a bit stumped, but \ngiven some guidance, would like to help figure out what\u0027s going on exactly.\n\nBest regards,\nChristian",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d5915)\nCode (and details) that fails to execute on 3.0.\n\nThere are two projects... aaw_common and aaw_product_tool (depending on\naaw_common).  Under 3.0, ProductTool.main() throws an IllegalStateException\nwhen run, under 2.1.1 it runs fine.\n\nPreferences and configuration details may be found in the top-level\naaw_product_tool directory.\n\nThis file is also available at: http://www.slac.com/cnelson/eclipse-bug.zip",
    "Problem reproduced. It comes from the fact the class literal is no longer \nsupposed to initialize the referenced class, which your code relies upon.\n\nFor instance, the following works fine:\n        try {\n            DefaultComboBoxModel cbm \u003d new DefaultComboBoxModel\n(EnumBean.getEnums(Class.forName(\"com.aaw.common.enum.ProductType\")).toArray());\n        }\n        catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\n        }\n\n\nAlso see bug 37565 for further details.\n\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 37565 ***"
