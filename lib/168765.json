    "In order to let users create or consume Axis2 Web service components in an Eclipse workspace, the Web service development tools need to have access to the Axis2 jars to copy them to the Web project containing the Web service component. Currently, the latest Axis2 version available is Axis2 1.1. If WTP includes a copy of the Axis2 jars in a plugin, similar to the current implementation of the tools for Axis 1.3, WTP will need to keep updating the plugin with newer releases of Axis2 as they become available. Not only is this extra work for the development team and the legal team, but it may inconvenience those users who have invested in an earlier release of Axis2 and do not want to be forced to move up to the latest version. \n\nSo this enhancement request is to let the user specify which version of Axis2 release they want to use similar to how they currently install server runtime.  The user would download the version of Axis2 they want into their machine and then use \"install Web service rutnime\" to point the Axis2 Web service tools to the location of the download (in zip or unzipped form).",
    "This RFE is subordinate to RFE bug 165664. Targetted to WTP 2.0 M5.",
    "Not contained in M5. Deferred to M6.",
    "This RFE actually contains two aspects:\n\n1. Allowing user to specify the Axis2 runtime install location.  This is to avoid having to ship plugins containing Axis2 JARs.\n\n2. Allowing user to specify different versions of Axis2 runtime.  This would require designing an extension point that encapsulate Axis2 runtime install characteristics, and then supplying the extension for Axis2 1.1 and future releases of Axis2.\n\nFor the purpose of scheduling the work into milestones, we are going to use this RFE to address item #1.  I\u0027ve opened RFE bug 173528 to address item #2.\n\nWith just item #1, then we would only support Axis2 v1.1 and future releases that behave similar to v1.1 (e.g. same directory structure, JAR names, emitter class name etc.). ",
    "The code for this RFE is included in the attachment zip contributed for bug 172186.\n\nThere\u0027s a few other comments/problems with attachment 59079 in bug 172186:\n\n1. It\u0027s probably more intuitive to let the user specify the Axis2 install location rather than the location of the Axis2 Web app in the preference page.\n\n2. There should be an general \"Axis2\" preference page with 2 pages:  Runtime install location and Code generation preference (for emitter and AAR generation).\n\n3. In the Axis2 runtime install location preference page, as soon as the user enters the location of the Axis2 install, the code should automatically validate that it is a valid Axis2 install location (e.g. by checking for some signature files or JARs).  An error message should be displayed if it\u0027s not valid.  This is similar to the checking done in Install Tomcat runtime.\n\n4. Instead of using Java Properties, we should use Eclipse preference store to store and retrieve preference settings.  See AxisEmitterPreference page, AxisEmitterContext and PersistentAxisEmitterContext for an example.\n\n5. I tried installing Axis2 facet but the facet install did not add the JARs.  It seems like the path to the Axis2 location was not retrieved properly in Windows (\"/\" is missing).",
    "Also, in attachment 59076, the code in the various plugins still calls the classes in the Axis2 JARs statically so it\u0027s still relying on the org.apache.axis2 JARs to be there in order to get a clean compile.  Those code needs to be updated to call the Axis2 classes reflectively.",

    "Lahiru (comment 6),\nyou wrote \"the axis2 facet will get rid of all the content in the webcontent directory\". I do not think this is acceptable.\n\nFacets are meant to add capabilities to a project. They should absolutely never take anything away, and I\u0027m not aware of any precedents in WTP to the contrary.

    "Recoding some discussions I had with Lahiru on 02/20:\n\u003ckc\u003e - by Kathy Chan\n\u003cls\u003e - by Lahiru Sandakith\n\nThe update note\nImprovements\n\n* As Comment 3 requests made the facet version fix. Also include a\nun-install facet function. But I believe that we need to put the dynamic\nweb projects back as it is to the state where it was before the axis2\nfacet included to this. Since the introduction of the axis2 facet will\nget rid of all the content in the webcontent directory \u003ckc\u003eIs getting ride of all content in \nWebContent directory really necessary or is just adding the Axis2 stuffs enough?\u003c/kc\u003e \n\u003cls\u003e Currently Axis2 stuff was added to the Content Directory so that all the stuff in the content (which was there default when we create a dynamic project) directory will replace by the axis2 stuff, in uninstall option we just need to get everything under the Content directory. Thats why I said as above. As I understand the Content directory is a valuable entry in the Dynamic Web Project, at the deployment it treats the content in that directory as exploded web application built in if the necessary directory structure is there. Bases on this reasoning i included the axis2 content also under the content directory. The whole Idea behind is that the user also supplied with the web console provided from the axis2 webapp (in the mean time we do all the other stuff from wizards) when ever the user deploy the Dynamic web project on servlet container. (Mean When the user just instruct the Dynamic web project to deploy in the tomcat servlet container, the directory structure is there for the Axis2 webapp admin console as well to access if needed form the web client popup by eclipse IDE on the fly ).\nWhat I am\nthinking of is to backup the content before the facet inclusion and then\nat the uninstall function restore them. Currrently it just delete the\nwhole content at the uninstall delegate. Please give your comments on\nthis...\u003ckc\u003eYes.  I think uninstall should restore the Web project back to original state.\n\u003cls\u003e Ok.\n Do you also \nchange the Java output location as well during Axis2 facet install?  \n\u003cls\u003eNo, but can do this,I assume that we have to stick to the automatic build, since if some one did a manual clean build, it will swipe all the content created. \nYou would have to restore that as well. \nI think facet uninstall is a lower priority item.  I\u0027ve open bug 174874 to track this.  We can revisit this that once we \nget the basic facet install and Axis2 scenarios working.\u003c/kc\u003e \n\u003cls\u003e ok.\n\n* As Comment 5 got rid of the org.apache.axis2 static dependencies and\nmade the code compiles through reflection and no need of axis2-*.jars to\ncompile the code.

If we can include the stax-api.jar or any\nother jar which contains these XML related stuff. Need your feedback on\nthis as well. \u003ckc\u003eSince the Axis2 plugins are going in for WTP 2.0, it is OK to depend on JDK15 if we have \nto.  I just double check with David Williams and he said that\u0027s OK for the HEAD build to depend on Java 5.0.  I think this is \nwhat needs to be done for those projects that depends on Java 5.0 for QName: \n- In the PDE, you should go to project properites of the projects, select \"Enable project specific setting\" and set to Java \ncompiler compliance level of 5.0. \n\u003cls\u003eyes, Thanks, done. \n- Edit Manifest.mf, add J2SE-1.5 as the minimum execution environment and click \"Update the classpath and the compiler compliance settings\".  This will add the line \"Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: J2SE-1.5\" to manifest.mf.\u003c/kc\u003e\n\u003cls\u003eDid this. Thanks\n\n* Comment 4\n\n1) did the fix, The current situation is to build the axis2.war, user\nneed to get the binary dist and at the webapp directory do a ant build.\nIf this is acceptable or shall we automate that .. Thoughts..\n\u003ckc\u003eCould you please eleborate on what exactly the user has to do with a binary download of Axis2 1.1 in \norder for it to run with the Axis2 plugins in WTP?  That is, what exactly is the Axis2 runtime install preference looking \nfor and why?  I thought it only needs the JARs to copy to the Web project and to invoke the emitter?   \nSince I could not specify Axis2 runtime install preference properly (I have not done any manual Ant build on the binary distribution), I could not run the latest code you sent.\u003c/kc\u003e \n\u003cls\u003emaybe the my question is not clear. What I understood was Dynamic web project has the direct features underline, so what we support earlier was obtained the axis2.war and then proceed ahead. Earlier org.apache.axis2 plugin was a representation axis2.war in the exploded format. What the axis2 binary distribution lag to fit in here is the distribution does not include the axis2.war on the fly, rather it needs to build it invoking a ant call from the \u003caxis2_home\u003e/webapp directory. The ant call just put together stuff distributed in the binary distribution in to one webpp. So my question was rather than instructing the user to invoke a ant command in the webapp directory, we just do that underline when the user select the axis2 home and prepare a Dynamic Web Project supportable artifact containing the axis2 stuff ( including libraries). In the middle of the process we also can validate also. (Libs exist, etc ). Please give your comments..\n\n2) Yes\n\n3) Doing improvements to make the error msg popup through the preference\npage itself.\n\n4) Yep, current code does not reflect the proposed, \n\u003ckc\u003eI\u0027ve open bug 174876 for Axis2 preference not reading in and storing the preference state properly.\u003c/kc\u003e\n\u003cls\u003e Ok, will do the improvements appropriate. \n\n5) Fixed .\n",
    "Lahiru (comment 8),\nthanks for clarifying.\n\nIt seems web.xml is the sole point of intersection between a project with Axis2\nand a project without Axis2. For now, let\u0027s assume it is the reasonable\nresponsibility of the Axis2 Facet to install the Axis2 servlets, mappings, etc.\ninto web.xml. The question becomes why web.xml is not \"worth editing\" and can\ninstead simply be replaced.\n\nReplacing web.xml may be OK if the user\u0027s first activity in a new Web project\nis to add the Axis2 facet or use the wizards to create an Axis2 service.\nReplacing web.xml is not appropriate if the user chooses to create Axis2\nservices in a Web project in which they\u0027ve previously developed other Web\ncontent. We also need the Axis2 facet to handle projects without the Web facet\n(ie. without web.xml), such as EJB projects, Client Application projects, and\nJava utility projects.\n\nThe Axis2 facet needs to detect the presence of web.xml and, if it exists,\nselectively add the necessary servlet, servlet-mapping, etc. fragments to\nweb.xml such that duplicate entries are avoided (such as if the user imports an\nAxis2 WAR originally created outside of the IDE) and such that all other\nnon-Axis2 content is preserved.\n\nThe corollary to this is that the facet should, when uninstalled, selectively remove the Axis2 servlet, servlet-mapping, etc. entries from web.xml and leave all non Axis-2 content intact.\n\nBTW, could you attach web.xml as it currently looks after your Axis2 facet\nworks its current magic? For example, I\u0027m not sure how it relates to\nmodules/webapp/conf/web.xml from the Axis2 distribution.\n\nThanks - CB.\n",
    "Here\u0027s what I found with attachment 59445:\n\n1.

After running \"ant\" in the \u003caxis_install_location\u003e/webapp directory and generating \u003caxis_install_location\u003e/dist/axis2.war, I can successfully specify the Axis2 runtime location pointing to the axis_install_location and create a dynamic Web project adding the Axis2 facet and choosing the Tomcat 5.0 runtime.  I noticed that axis2.war exists under WebContent.  As brought up in previous discussion, I don\u0027t think we should have a .war sitting in the Eclipse workspace.  It should be there in an expanded form.\n\n5. The JSPs added by Axis2 facet still has compile error.  I\u0027ve opened bug 175013 to track this.\n\n6.

    "Lahiru (comment 12),\nthanks.\n\nHaving the Axis2 facet depend upon the jst.web facet means that the Axis2 facet cannot be used to equip a non-Web project with the Axis2 jars. Though reasonable for development of Axis2 services, I think this limits users\u0027 ability to develop Axis2 clients which should be able to reside in any kind of Java project. Perhaps this is OK for WTP 2.0, though there are a couple ideas we should muse over first:\n\n1. Define two Axis2 facets, one for services and that depends on jst.web (the one you\u0027ve defined), and one for clients that doesn\u0027t.\n\n2. Remove the dependency on jst.web and incorporate it instead into the appropriate serviceRuntime and clientRuntime extensions to the Web service platform.\n\nYou can ignore my last question about attaching web.xml.
