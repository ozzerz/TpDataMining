    "Recent workbench builds are throwing an exception when we do simple file \ndeletes. The exception comes from LTK (see pasted entry below).\n\nThis could be the same as bug 72633, which has the same exception in the error \nlog. This does not reproduce in a product (RAD) built on 7-September-04, so \nit\u0027s a recent regression.\n\nThe UI shows this error message:\n\nAn exception has been caught while processing the refactoring \u0027Delete\u0027.\nReason:\n Problems encountered while deleting resources.\n\nSteps to reproduce the problem:\nCreate a new Java project\nChange to java perspective\nRight click on project name; choose new\u003efile; create a plain empty file\nRight click on the new file\nChoose delete\nGet the error message\n\nThis appears in the error log:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ltk.ui.refactoring 4 10000 Sep 21, 2004 14:45:14.375\n!MESSAGE Internal Error\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Problems encountered while deleting \nresources.\n\tat \norg.eclipse.ltk.internal.ui.refactoring.UIPerformChangeOperation.executeChange\n(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.ltk.core.refactoring.PerformChangeOperation.run(Unknown \nSource)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.run(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.ltk.internal.ui.refactoring.WorkbenchRunnableAdapter.run\n(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run\n(Unknown Source)\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.core.resources 4 4 Sep 21, 2004 14:45:14.390\n!MESSAGE Problems encountered while deleting resources.\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.core.resources 4 273 Sep 21, 2004 14:45:14.390\n!MESSAGE Could not delete: E:\\RAD\\workspace\\foo\\probe.probe.",
    "Further attempts to reproduce this show that it might only happen when a \nproprietary product is layered on top of Eclipse. I\u0027m going to resolve this as \nWORKSFORME, and file a new one if we can get it to happen with bare Eclipse."
