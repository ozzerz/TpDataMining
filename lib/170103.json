    "Build ID:  I20061214-1445\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. My test execution hangs at 54% when launching AGR tests with IAC in standard mode. \n2. Ali has also reported that he is getting stuck at 60% when launching AGR tests with IAC (with no wrokaround).\n\nMore information:\nI am using IBM JRE 1.5 SR3 with Eclispe SDK 3.3.0 and EMF 2.3. TPTP build: 4.4 (200701080100). However, since it has gotten stuck at 54% in 4.4 I have not been able to launch any kind of test with IAC with older TPTP builds (4.3.0, 4.2.1). I noticed this error in the .log file: \n!ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.launching 4 113 2007-01-10 10:34:47.703\n!MESSAGE Failed to connect to remote VM.

    "After deleting some dll files from the WINDOWS/system32 directory I was able to bypass the problem and run AGR tests with IAC in both 4.3 GA version and 4.4 current driver. Ali, are you still having troubles getting stuck at 60%?",
    "Test execution with IAC works fine on my laptop but it still hangs at 60% on my desktop.  I\u0027m sure it\u0027s a configuration problem but I just can\u0027t figure out what is causing it.",
    "It works for me. Please make sure there is no other DLL\u0027s in your path which might cause IAC to load them inappropriately.",
    "Set target to 4.4 i1.",
    "I have reopened this defect as I cannot get IAC to run AGR test cases on Linux ia32. I have resolved the problem on Windows XP but in the 4.4i1 TP2 driver I cannot get the Linux ia32 IAC to run AGR tests despite my best efforts at making sure no old RACs are installed etc. It consistently hangs at 54%. ",
    "I suspect you will encounter the same symptom using Linux AC. Can you confirm?",
    "The Linux AC works fine with the Candidate driver and AGR tests on the same machine.  I was able to run a test in standard mode after starting the AC but not with the IAC.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d59796)\nPatched libhclaunch.so\n\nHi Liz. Can you try this patch by replacing the \"libhclaunch.so\" under \"plugins/org.eclipse.hyades.execution.linux.x86_4.3.0.v200702070100\"?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d59797)\nPatch #1\n\n",
    "The problem is caused by a Linux environment variable which contains control characters. The native-to-UTF8 conversion failed and a NULL is passed to the JNI\u0027s NewStringUTF8() function. This caused the JVM to crash.\n\nThe fix is to detect a failed native-to-UTF8 conversion and skip this kind of control character embedded name/value pair when retrieving the system environment variables.\n",
    "Entered bug sizing.",
