    "Irregardless of what I do, I\u0027m not able to reproduce this defect.  Here are the different permutations that I have tested with:\n\nIAC with Sun-SDK-1.5.0_11\nIAC with Sun-SDK-1.4.2_13\nIAC with IBM-SDK-1.5\n\nAC on command prompt with Sun-SDK-1.5.0_11\nAC on command prompt with Sun-SDK-1.4.2_13\nAC on command prompt with IBM-SDK-1.5\n\nI also have code in trace.ui to cause a time-out after 10 seconds.  The maximum time for the monitor tree not to be populated should not exceed 30 seconds (I have tested this as well).  Normally the tree should get populated within 5 seconds if IAC is starting the Agent Controller or 1-2 seconds if AC has manually been started.\n\nIf both PI and the TI data collectors are appearing, then the client is not able to establish a connection with your Agent Controller.  Please make sure that your firewall is configured properly and that you\u0027re not selecting \"Local Direct Connection\" under the host tab.\n\nI\u0027m marking this as works for me but if you\u0027re able to consistently reproduce this, then let\u0027s work together to determine what is different between our machines.\n\n\n",

    "This is happening on my hyper-threaded desktop machine using IBM JDK1.5 and Sun 1.4.2_10",
    "After restarting my Eclipse workbench and re-generating IAC\u0027s config files, I was able to make this work.  I\u0027m no longer getting the exceptions.  ",
    "This exception is caused when the configuration file for the execution framework is not generated.  Unfortunatly the Agent Controller is started even when this configuration file is not generated, which leads to the exception Ali has noted.  If the Agent Controller detected this problem and prevented from starting then we wouldn\u0027t have this problem.  There is another defect open to add in a config validator in IAC so that it wouldn\u0027t start up when this configuration file hasn\u0027t been generated properly.  This defect is really a duplicate of bug 184039.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 184039 ***"
