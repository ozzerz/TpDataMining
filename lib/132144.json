    "In Eclipse 3.1 the Platform#getBundle(String) method would return null if the platform was not yet started.  In the latest 3.2 builds it will throw an NPE.\n\nWe make no guarantees on the Platform API WRT the OSGi environment if the platform is not started in an OSGi environment.  But still we probably did not intend to introduce an NPE here.\n\nThe reason the NPE occurs is because the BundleContext is null for core.runtime when it tries to construct a ServiceTracker.  Here is a portion of the stacktrace\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.osgi.util.tracker.ServiceTracker.\u003cinit\u003e(ServiceTracker.java:162)\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.getBundleAdmin(Int\nernalPlatform.java:1051)\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.getBundle(Internal\nPlatform.java:252)\n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.getBundle(Platform.java:1339)\n\nIt should be easy to avoid the NPE and return null in this case ...",
    "There was a little bit more than this to it. Most of the methods would have failed in the same way. I released a fix in HEAD."
