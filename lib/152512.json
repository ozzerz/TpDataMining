    "Tried to open report from this Mylar changeset in sync view:\n[mkersten] (Aug 1, 2006 12:19:28 PM) Completed: 36: create custom explorer view/https://qualicum.cs.ubc.ca/tasks/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d36\n\n-- Error Log --\nDate: Tue Aug 01 13:31:19 PDT 2006\nMessage: Unable to open Bug report: 36\n\nSeverity: Error\nPlugin ID: org.eclipse.mylar.core\nStack Trace:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.internal.bugzilla.ui.tasklist.OpenBugzillaReportJob.run(OpenBugzillaReportJob.java:68)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)",
    "Fixed. Warning dialog now shown saying that a repository for the given url does not exist and that it needs to be configured via the Task Repositories view. ",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d47185)\nmylar/context/zip\n\n",
    "Why I can\u0027t view such reports without adding repository?",
    "Currently we need it for the username and password, but perhaps we should auto construct the repository and just leave the username and password blank? Or open a browser window? Mik?",
    "I\u0027d be fine with the browser-based viewer...",
    "Yes, you can just fall back to using TaskUiUtil.openUrl(..) to open it if there is no repository.  But I still think that the warning dialog is a good idea because it is not \u0027normal\u0027 for us to open a task with a web editor when we have a rich editor.",
    "(In reply to comment #6)\n\u003e Yes, you can just fall back to using TaskUiUtil.openUrl(..) to open it if there\n\u003e is no repository.  But I still think that the warning dialog is a good idea\n\u003e because it is not \u0027normal\u0027 for us to open a task with a web editor when we have\n\u003e a rich editor.\n\nMaybe you can create implicit not persisted repository. Or instead of warning either suggest to open issue with browser or suggest to create repository from given URL. \n\nBTW, most of the repositories allow to browse anonymously and only require credentials when submitting new reports.\n\n",
    "Implemented as per comment#6. If at some point this becomes a show stopper we can open a new report.",
    "Sounds good.  The \"implicit persisted\" repository sounds would probably be too much work for this corner case.\n\nRegarding the anonymous access I created bug 152548\n\n",
    "You could still  to create repository instead of showing a warning...",
    "Yes, but what I\u0027m saying is that it\u0027s not worth the effort given the benefit.  We constantly have to weight the benefit of all tasks that come up against the outstanding list.  However, I do think that once automatic creation and anonymous access are done and solid we should revisit this idea of events that could trigger repository creation.  I think the driver will be reporting an error for a plug-in whose associated repository does not exist."
