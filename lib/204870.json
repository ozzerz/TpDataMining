    " (In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e I can\u0027t reproduce. Can you please explain what \"Replicate by selecting text in\n\u003e the Description of the following bug\" mean?\n\nPlace cursor in Description of that issue, hold mouse down, and do a selection of all the text.  However, I can\u0027t replicate with the issue I linked.  I\u0027ve can\u0027t reliably reproduce it with the same issue, but I can always get it to happen by trying few issues.  Try selecting description or comment text in a few issues that you work with and let me know if you see it.",
    "I still can\u0027t reproduce and haven\u0027t seen it with any other issues I work with. So, I\u0027ve committed a fix to do some paranoid checking for the range bounds.\n\nBTW, do you have a jira repository that has project with key \"re\" or anything like that?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d80199)\nmylyn/context/zip\n\n",
    " (In reply to comment #3)\n\u003e BTW, do you have a jira repository that has project with key \"re\" or anything\n\u003e like that?\n\nNo, I haven\u0027t encountered a key like that.  Why?  I\u0027ll reopen if I see this again.",
    "Marking fixed.",
    "(In reply to comment #5)\n\u003e No, I haven\u0027t encountered a key like that.  Why?\n\nI just saw some text like \"re-\" in the issue you\u0027ve referred to and was wondering if it somehow got matched to a jira key."
