    "M7\n\nAt some poit I suddendly couldn\u0027t set breakpoints anymore. The log shows:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.actions.ToggleBreakpointAdapter$2.run(ToggleBreakpointAdapter.java:160)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:67)",
    "*** Bug 95238 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Since we create breakpoints in background jobs now, it was possible to have a \njob run after the editor closes, in this case breakpoint creation is cancelled \n(the NPE indicated that an editor\u0027s document provider was null).\n\nJob is now cancelled when document provider is null. Also changed error \nreporting (we were incorrectly trying to display an error message in a dialog \nrather than simply returning the status code to the job manager, which will \nreport the error).\n\nChanges to ToggleBreakpointAdapter. Also removed two unused messages from \nActionMessages.java/.properties.",
