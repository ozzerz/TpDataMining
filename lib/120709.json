    "Hi Kathy,\nOdds look high that you\u0027re hitting the Windows path length problem on the JRE that you\u0027re using, and the path being \u003e 256 chars is the problem. Did you recently switch JREs or start using longer paths for your workspace, application, or classname? The quick test would be to try a smaller example or switch to c:\\work as your workspace and see if that solves it.",
    "I hit this problem again with RC5.  This time, I\u0027ve used a much shorter name for workspace.  Here\u0027s the publish error:\n\nPublishing failed\n  Error copying file to d:\\rad\\rad7_1213_workspace1216b\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\\tmp0\\webapps\\tc40\\WEB-INF\\lib\\wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar: Error deleting d:\\rad\\rad7_1213_workspace1216b\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\\tmp0\\webapps\\tc40\\WEB-INF\\lib\\wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar\n\nIt does not look like it\u0027s hitting the 256 character limit.",
    "If you stop the runtime between each publish operation, does the problem go away.\n\nI\u0027m thinking WIN32 jar locking is the issue here.  Between M9 and RC1 publishing changed and additional error checking for failed delete was added (which was not in there before).\n\nThe method works perfectly on a unix based system but I can\u0027t vouch for its effects on WIN32 system.  If platform specific behaviour is needed maybe I can help work something out for WIN32.\n\n\nThe reason why I ask about JAR locking is that TC 5.5 has special workarounds that can be enabled (with side effects, see TC documentation):\n\n\u003cContext ... antiJARLocking\u003d\"true\" antiResourceLocking\u003d\"true\" ...\u003e\n\nwhich may help.  AFAIK neither TC 4.x or TC 5.0.x support this, I\u0027m not sure if this is because it needs a JDK5 feature to support it or just that no one has back-ported the functionality into the older TC releases.\n",
    "Given that it is not the path limit problem I think Darryl is probably correct that the server is already using the jar (causing the file to be locked) and that\u0027s why publishing failed. Please try Darryl\u0027s suggesting and see if the problem still occurs when stopping or restarting the server before this test, which would unlock the file.\n\nAny chance that the jar is changing between the first publish and the one that is now failing? The other oddity is that publishing is normally incremental, so this jar would not be publishing unless it has changed since the previous publish.",
    "No.  The Axis JARs are not changing during different Web services runs.

    "Refering to comment #16, using the 0214 M101 driver, here\u0027s what the Web services scenario does when the problem occured:\n\n- generate files to source and WebContent folder of Web project \"tc50\"\n- add Web project \"tc50\" to server, publish/start/restart if necessary \n- create Web project \"tc50Client\"\n- generate files to source folder of \"tc50Client\", \n- add Web project \"tc50Client\" to server, publish/start/restart if necessary \n- generate JSPs into WebContent of \"tc50Client\", publish/start/restart if necessary \n\nThe code that checks for if publish/start/restart is necessary or not is in the StartServerCommand.  It calls publish if shouldPublish returns true, then checks the server state.  If server state is stopped, it starts the server.  If server state is started, it restart server if shouldRestart returns true.\n\nNote that in the second publish after the JSPs are generated, the Java code in the source directory of \"tc50Client\" would not have changed.  So, I\u0027m not sure why the publish code would try to publish ConverterSoapBindingStub.class\nagain.\n\nAlso, you indicated that the problem is during the second publish when  deleting returns OK, but the file still exist.  Could you just replace the content of the file with the newly file content if delete returns OK?  That is, bypass the exist() check?  Are you just doing Java file I/O at that point?\n\nYou also suspect the problem might be Tomcat is still holding on the file during the first publish when the second publish is being called.  That\u0027s why the first delete did not complete.  So, would this be some sort of timing problem the server tooling code needs to handle?",
    "I\u0027m told on the Tomcat developer list that 4.1.32 of Tomcat will support the antiJARLocking\u003d\"true\" \u003cContext ..\u003e attribute, but no support for antiResourceLocking\u003d\"true\".  I dont think 4.1.32 has been released yet.\n\nThere are no plans underway to backport from 5.5.x the same functions into 5.0.x but such a patch would be acceptable.  No new development has been done on 5.0.x in sometime.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion would be to implement for WIN32 Eclipse an automatic (hidden) retry stratagy on all failed resources from the last the publish operation after some minimal delay before signalling an error to the user.  I would like to understand if the .class file locking is a momentry problem where the running JVM and Eclipse are both trying to use the same file.\n\n\nA publish operation is started\n\nNormal publishing takes place, any resources error with unlink() or rename() are put on an error list.  So the original delta change information is retained.\nContinue the publish all other resources that would not be affected by previous errors.\n\nNow instead of throwing an error here, we keep the existing publish task inprogress, maybe signal to the user we are \"Publishing (2nd pass)\" if thats possible, we then throw the error delta list back to publish again.\n\nNow if we make progress with the list this time, i.e. 1 or more resources sucessfully published and was removed from the list, we delay and repeat the process.\n\nNow if we made no progress with the list this time, we signal whats left in it to the user and mark the publish operation into an error state.\n\n\nThen all we need to do is tweak a few parameters, these parameters could be \"mimimumNumberOfPublishAttempts\" and \"publishRetryDelayMiliseconds\".\n\nThis heuristic should only be implemented on the WIN32 platform.  On unix we should collect the error list and not implment any retry stratagy, we show resource failure after the 1st pass.\n\nWe just have to accept that Java the platform was implemented by a leading UNIX vendor and so has an inherrant UNIX view on how the computing world words.\n\n\n\nFirst we should establish if the above would be a useable workaround maybe a patched up org.eclipse.jst.server.core could be done that for every failed unlink() or rename() we replaced with a new function that would try 3 times with 1500ms delay between tries.  See if Kathy observes any improvement.\n\n\n\nI always use Unix with eclipse the history of the problem and the reasons for the changes circa 1.0RC1 are thus.\n\n(In reply to comment #17)\n\u003e Also, you indicated that the problem is during the second publish when \n\u003e deleting returns OK, but the file still exist.  Could you just replace the\n\u003e content of the file with the newly file content if delete returns OK?  That is,\n\u003e bypass the exist() check?  Are you just doing Java file I/O at that point?\n\nBlindly replacing the contents is something I dont want on Unix.  Since it will let you (even if the TC-JVM is using the file at the same time) this results in TC-JVM coredumps and crashes, since the data is corrupt (from the TC-JVMs point of view).\n\nTC-JVM opens file\nTC-JVM reads part of the file of the file (or in the case of a JAR jumps to the directory info at end of file and reads it)\nEclipse (at this moment) opens same file and truncates it\nEclipse writes out new and different contents for that file\nEclipse closes file\nTC-JVM still has open file handle on Unix, since the file was not unlink()ed and by default there is no access locking (your application has to use a file locking API it it wants locking) then the file handle points to the same file instance with now different contents.\nTC-JVM seeks to offset (since the contents have changed under it the correct offset could be different, but TC-JVM doesn\u0027t know this)\nTC-JVM reads data\nTC-JVM processes data and crashes (I was getting ~3 a day on unix)\n\nThe correct way on UNIX to deal with this is to call unlink() or rename() then the TC-JVM file handle still points to filesys backed file that is unlinked from the file system directory tree.  And the new contents end up in a new file instance and are visible to the next program to call open().  Both applications are happy and if the rename() API is used the changeover is done atomically.\n\nThe current situation in Eclipse that now exists (since ~1.0RC1) on Unix is good, we are using unlink() then rename() rather than pure rename() which would be ideal.  The window of time the TC-JVM tries to open() a file that Eclipse hasn\u0027t yet called rename() for is minimal.\n\nIt would be ideal in eclipse to have in org.eclipse.jst.server.core:\n\nif(EclipsePlatformRuntime.isWIN32())\n unlink(file);\n\nnewFile.renameTo(file);\n\n\n\nIn the case of WIN32 rename() can only rename if the destination file does not exist.  This is not the case on UNIX an implicit unlink() is done on the destination file this is what the whole operation atomic :).\n\nIn the case of WIN32 both unlink() and rename() fail if another handle is open on the file and default/standard locking in place.  I\u0027m not sure if root of the problem is WIN32\u0027s default locking or if the WIN32 platform just doesn\u0027t support the concept of open filehandle to an unlinked file that UNIX does.\n",
    "Raising severity ...\n\nI\u0027m seeing the \"publish fail\" error again on the WTP 101 candidate M200602171228 driver.  This time, I ran through Web services skeleton scenario with Web project \"tc55b\" on a Tomcat 5.0 server.  So Java files were created in that project, Axis JARs were added to WebContent, Web project added to the server, server publish is called and restarted.  That top-down skeleton Web service works fine by testing with the Web Services Explorer.\n\nThen I select the WSDL file in tc55b and select to create Web service client into Web project \"tc55c\".  This resulted in Java files being created, Axis JARs and JSPs added to WebContent directory of tc55c.  Then tc55c is added to the started server, server publish and restart is called (actuall call to server only happens if doPublish and doRestart returns true).  However, I am getting the publish error in tc55b (saaj.jar would not have changed between the last publish of tc55b and this publish).

Can you quote the Eclipse project config files that link it in (just trying to get a picture of your project).\n\n\n* Is it a static JAR copied into the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory ?\n\n* Is it a linked JAR and configured in .classpath config file ?\n\n* Is it an exported JAR from another project and that project is configured in .project, .classpath and .settings/.component config files ?\n\n* Does it have a special handler that exports it into the project in some other way (a but like J2EE Utility Projects do) ?\n\n\nThe reason I ask if you mention the Web Service wizards are editing the configuration of projects on behalf of the developer, I\u0027m trying to establish the nature of this re-configuration.\n\nYour comment indicates that an saar.jar should have published cleanly from the previous publish operation.  So maybe some areas to investigate are a modification event propagating from somewhere (altering the resource unecessasily) or jst.server is calculating its publish deltas incorrectly and over publishing files.\n\n\nWould I be correct in saying you have two TC runtime instances active at the same time ?  Or do you have one TC runtime instance and two web-apps deployed ?  The reason I ask is I can see tmp1 in use in the path.\n\n\nI think my proposal in my previous comment will address problems on Win32 where WEB-INF/classes/**/*.class and *.jsp files are involved, as I think those problems are momentry clashing with TC access to load those files.  JAR files however maybe caused by persisting system mmap() access leading to locking, this is a form of caching.\n\n\nWithin the TC documentation it is mentioned that Xerces uses getResource() method in such a way to make the JVM attempts to cache the access (and cause locking to occur).  Maybe your Web Services make extensive use of similar mechanisms (that you may not have any control over) and this is why you are being stung more than most.\n",
    "Fix (publishing trying multiple times before failing in case server has the file locked) is provided via bug 125524.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 125524 ***",
    "I\u0027m still seeing similar publish problem with the WTP 1.5 0518 driver.  Here\u0027s the error:\n\nPublishing failed\n  Error copying file WEB-INF\\classes\\com\\ibm\\wsm\\samples\\retail\\ec\\EnterpriseCustomer.class: Could not replace with temp file D:\\rad7\\0530_0247\\install\\workspaceSUN0602b\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.jst.server.core\\tmp38834.class.\n\nThis happens in a scenario where the Tomcat 5.5 server had just been newly added and the Web module has just been added to the server.  After I dismiss the error dialog, the Web module has been added to the server successfully.",
    "1) Is this during the first copy of the module to the server, or a subsequent publish?\n2) Can you check whether the following file exists within the published webapp:\ncom\\ibm\\wsm\\samples\\retail\\ec\\EnterpriseCustomer.class?\n3) Is this problem reproducable? Can you provide a testcase?\n\nChecking out the error message, it has tried to delete EnterpriseCustomer.class from the published webapp (if it existed) and this appears to have worked. However, it was unable to move the tempfile (containing new contents) into its place.",
    "I\u0027m getting this problem again with the WTP 1.5 RC4 driver.  It always happens on a subsequent publish to the server.  So the class already exist in the .metadata\\org.eclipse.wst.server.core directory.  I can also see the temp file in the org.eclipse.jst.server.core directory.\n\nWhen I get this error:\nPublishing failed\n  Error copying file WEB-INF\\classes\\echo\\EchoProxy.class: Could not replace with temp file D:\\eclipse32RC3\\eclipse\\runtimeworkspace_wtp0606a\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.jst.server.core\\tmp10349.class.\n\nI was able to find and delte the WEB-INF\\classes\\echo\\EchoProxy.class and replace with \\eclipse\\runtimeworkspace_wtp0606a\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.jst.server.core\\tmp10349.class manually and rename it to EchoProxy.class.\n\nUnfortunately, this problem is not reproducible everytime.  I have seen it a few times in these couple of weeks though.\n",
    "*** Bug 123908 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Can anyone still reproduce this? Given the other fixes and attempts to bend over backwards when the server has files locked, I have not seen or heard of this bug recently. Unless someone can respond with a failure on a recent 1.5.1 build I would like to close this one.",
    "Closing (again) since nobody has responded.\n\nAs noted above, unless there is a minor bug in implementation I think we\u0027ve done all we can and users should not hit this problem anymore. The publishing code catches cases of locked files and tries either switching file handles instead of removing the old file or waiting and trying again. Error messages have been improved and if anyone still hits this it is most likely that the server truly does have the file locked and there is no way to replace it.",
    "Have not seen the problems lately.  Thanks Tim!",
    "Closing.",
    "This is part of a \"mass update\" where bugs showing \"fixed\" between 7/1/2006 and 9/27/2006 are assumed fixed in WTP 1.5.1. feel free to change the target milestone if you know a more accurate setting. ",
    "I have been experiencing this problem with the Eclipse 3.2.1 + WTP 1.5.2 - After much fiddling, trying multiple versions of various pieces of software I discovered that it was my installed JDK version that was the problem.  Eclipse was running on  1.5.0_5.  The moment I installed 1.5.0_10 all these problems went away."
