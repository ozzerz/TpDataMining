    "I\u0027m trying to connect to cvs using ext or extssh from Eclipse (currently using\nv3.1M3, but this has been a problem ever since I left 3.0M4) on WinXP.\n\nWhen I try to add a new location (filling out the form properly, I\u0027m quite\nconvinced), I get the message: \"Error validating location \"\". Keep location\nanyway?\" If I opt to keep the location, I can\u0027t see any of the projects in the\nrepository I\u0027m supposed to be browsing. \n\nSomehow, it seems that the repository path isn\u0027t read. When I try to add the\nsame connection with pserver, everything works fine.\n\nI\u0027m experiencing this on a dualboot laptop with WinXP SP2. When I boot up in\nLunix (Red Hat Enteroruse Linux release 3) I have no trouble making a CVS\nconnection using ext.",
    "Is there anything in the Error log?",
    "What CVS server version are you using? Is there anything in the Error log?",
    "Probably because your ssh account on the server is not configured correctly. We\nall run extssh daily without problems.",
    "\u003e What CVS server version are you using?\n\nSorry for the late reply!\n\nMy cvs client:\nConcurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.17 (client/server)\n\nOn the cvs server:\nConcurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.5 (client/server)\n\n\u003e Is there anything in the Error log?\n\nIf the log you\u0027re referring to is Eclipse-3.1M3\\workspace\\.metadata\\.log, here\nis what I get:\n\nAt the dialog mentioned: \"Error validating location \"\". Keep location\nanyway?\", nothing is written to the log. But if I decide to keep this location,\nand try to browse the contents of HEAD, the following is written to the log:\n\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 2004-12-17 10:48:42.428\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Fetching children of HEAD\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n    at com.jcraft.jsch.jce.DH.getE(Unknown Source)\n    at com.jcraft.jsch.jce.DHG1.init(Unknown Source)\n    at com.jcraft.jsch.Session.receive_kexinit(Unknown Source)\n    at com.jcraft.jsch.Session.connect(Unknown Source)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh2.JSchSession.getSession(JSchSession.java:298)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh2.CVSSSH2ServerConnection.internalOpen(CVSSSH2ServerConnection.java:117)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ssh2.CVSSSH2ServerConnection.open(CVSSSH2ServerConnection.java:99)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.Connection.open(Connection.java:127)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSRepositoryLocation.createConnection(CVSRepositoryLocation.java:549)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSRepositoryLocation.openConnection(CVSRepositoryLocation.java:790)\n    at org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.client.Session.open(Session.java:148)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performUpdate(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:94)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation$InternalRemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performUpdate(FetchMembersOperation.java:67)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:61)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:52)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation.execute(FetchMembersOperation.java:105)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.CVSOperation.run(CVSOperation.java:87)\n    at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.model.CVSTagElement.fetchDeferredChildren(CVSTagElement.java:133)\n    at\norg.eclipse.ui.progress.DeferredTreeContentManager$1.run(DeferredTreeContentManager.java:168)\n    at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66)\n\nRegarding Jean-Michel Lemieux\u0027s comment that my ssh account might not be\nconfigured properly on the server: Can this be an explanation, given the fact\nthat I connect smoothly with ext from another OS on the same computer? Should my\nssh account be configured differently server side, depending on whether I use\next or extssh?\n\nI\u0027m aware of the fact that this works for most people. It used to work for me as\nwell, when I used Eclipse v3.0 m4.\n\nAnyway, thanks for looking into this! If there\u0027s anything else I can do, please\nlet me know! Also, please let me know if it was wrong to reopen the bug. I fully\nunderstand if this bug (or mistake on my part) has a low priority.",

I\u0027ve tried everything I can think of, short of reinstalling\nthe whole OS. I don\u0027t want ot use pserver, so I\u0027m back to using cvs in command\nline :-/\n\nPlease share if someone comes across a solution!",
    "Just wanted to say that this is no longer an issue with the brand spanking new\nEclipse 3.1 :-)\n\nThanks for an excellent product!"
