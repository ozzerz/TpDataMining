    "Trying to run M4 results in a \n\nJVM Terminated.

    "I also tried ... \nC:\\Programme\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe -vm %JAVA_HOME%\\bin\\java.exe -\ndata \"\\\\zts10.muc\\QX33628\\eclipse\"\n\nThis netted the same results.\n\nIt seems that it is crashing when trying to create the lock file ? It creates \nthe workspace/.metadata directory but then nothing more. ",
    "M4 requires JDK 1.4.\n\nhttp://download2.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.0M4-200310101454/index.php\n\nstates \"You will need a 1.4 level Java runtime or Java development kit (JDK)\ninstalled on your machine in order to run Eclipse.\"",
    "Closing as invalid. As mentioned above, Eclipse 3.0 requires a 1.4 level VM. A\nseparate bug was open so the launcher is updated to provide a proper message\nwhen a VM lower than 1.4 is used (see bug 44814)",
    "Ho will this jive with the millions of corporate developers working on JDK \n1.3.1 based code? Id love to convert BMW to 1.4 but that would be something \nlike trying to convince all politicians to be honest."
