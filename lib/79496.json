    "What connection method are you using?",
    "ext, using ssh as a rsh replacement (CVS_RSH\u003dssh)",
    "Have you tried extssh? This connection method supports SSH 2. You can also \nconfigure the EXT connection method to use SSH2 when inside Eclipse in order \nto keep your sandbox compatible with command line tools (Team\u003eCVS\u003eExt \nConnection Method preference page). If you want to keep using ext, you will \nneed to configure the invokation parameters (on the same preference page as \nmentioned above) in order to provide the password. There is no way in java to \nsupport command line prompts.",
    "Marking as worksforme since this appears to be a configuration issue.",
    "Well, telling Eclipse to use extssh when connecting using ext method did the\ntrick, thanks for explanation! But then what ext is good for (except for\npuzzling users and generating invalid bug reports ;-) )? Shouldn\u0027t it be removed\nif using extssh instead does all ext does, and works always?\n\nOne important thing I think is that, as a minimum, user should be explicitly\ntold to try to configure Eclipse to use extssh instead of ssh if problem I\nexperienced is detected. Frankly, by myself, I\u0027d never guessed that I should do\nwhat needed to be done -- if Michael didn\u0027t tell me what to do I would just\nthink that Eclipse has one broken feature. That\u0027s bad and at the very least user\nshould be told what to do in (not that unusual I think) situation.",
    "The ext connection method is still required since there are other connection \ntools than SSH (e.g. rsh). They are not used frequently but they are used. We \nalready have a bug report or two about improving the error handling for ext.",
    "did you read the help?"
