    "When attaching to a logging agent as part of the org.eclipse.tptp.monitoring.tests Monitor.Execution manual test, a message dialog window pops up saying there was an internal error.  I\u0027ll attach the error message dialog.  The following stack trace is printed to the eclipse .log file:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2006-08-03 11:19:24.859\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Launching\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.internal.launcher.ProfileAttachDelegate.launch(ProfileAttachDelegate.java:252)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:639)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:565)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin.buildAndLaunch(DebugUIPlugin.java:754)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin$6.run(DebugUIPlugin.java:944)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\nThe attach is successful and I can start monitoring the agent and receive data in the Log View.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d47331)\nError message dialog when attaching to a logging agent\n\n",
    "Both the workbench and logging agent were running on the same Windows 2000 machine with IBM JDK 1.5.  The Agent Controller was also running on the machine.",
    "*** Bug 152878 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d47537)\npatch\n\n",
    "Dave and Thay,\n\nPlease verify the patch.  I would like to check this into 4.2.1.",
    "This was approved to be checked in 4.2.1 post i1",
    "The attached patch worked for me.  No error dialog popped up.",
    "Checked into both HEAD and 4.2.1 branch",
    "Re-opening defect. This is pending PG approval.",
    "I\u0027m moving this to critical because the error message can mislead the user in thinking that something has gone wrong while attaching to an agent.\n\nThe reporter can adjust the severity back to major if he doesn\u0027t agree.",
    "This was approved by PMC/PG and it has been checked in."
