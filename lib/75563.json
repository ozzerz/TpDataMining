One of the \nlinks is to the c:\\Program Files\\Eclipse3\\usr where each user can add his own \nplug-ins and features).\nAfter he added the plug-in he succeeded to open Eclipse, saw the new plug-in, \nand everything was ok till the Eclipse stuck to him. He than closed Eclipse and \ntried to reopen it- but he couldn\u0027t - he could get only the error message !\nThis had happened even after reboot, after removing the plug in, after removing \nthe plug-in directory, after removing the user private plug-ins option and even \nafter deleting the Eclipse link and create a new link. \n",
