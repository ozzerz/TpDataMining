    "Eclipse build I20050426-1700.\n\nTried running eclipse on Windows ME.\n3.1 didn\u0027t start (stack trace pasted below).\n3.0 didn\u0027t start either (no stack trace, but probably same error).\n2.1.3 runs fine.\n\nHere\u0027s the stack trace for the 3.1 failure. It was written to a numbered .log \nfile in the C:\\WINDOWS\\.eclipse\\configuration directory. Note that 3.0 fails \nwith a similar dialog message (\"Could not find framework\") however there is no \nlog written when 3.0 fails.\n\n!SESSION Fri Apr 29 17:29:35 EDT 2005 ------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Apr 29, 2005 17:29:35.420\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not find framework\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:624)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:266)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:951)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:935)",
    "I\u0027m a bit surprised since eclipse 3.0 is running on NT and 98 (McQ and I tested that before 3.0 shipped).\nWhere do we have a Win ME box?\n\nNote I don\u0027t think Windows ME belongs to the set of supported platforms.\n",
    "I have 3 partitions on my Windows box: XP, 2K, ME.\nDrop by and we can boot into ME.\n\nI was surprised also - I reported it to make sure that 98 was ok.\nYou are right that ME isn\u0027t in the supported list, but let\u0027s have a quick look \nto see if it is something simple.",
    "The startup code does some massaging of the install area to find the plugins\nfolder. One of the check consists in checking if a string ends up with \".jar\".\nOn ME, the file being checked ends up with \".JAR\", therefore it does not matched\nand then we fail finding the plugins folder.\n",
    "This is probably not specific to ME, but the FAT16/32 file system on the \npartition. You could require that users have a real file system ;-)",
    "Traveling back in time, I found similar issues in bug #19046.\nIt seems that when doing sharing of install is one of the main reasons for troubles.\nGiven that we are talking of unsupported platforms, I\u0027m releasing a fix that\nhelps this specific case.",
    "CAR, please verify the fix on your ME machine.  Thanks.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d21276)\nStartup.jar as it should be in the drop\n\nTo really recreate the condition of the bug, rename startup.jar in STARTUP.JAR",
    "Eclipse M7 starts up fine on ME now. Thanks, Pascal!"
