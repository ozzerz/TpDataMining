    "!SESSION Tue Aug 03 10:27:11 EDT 2004 -----------------------------------------\n-\nI cannot run eclipse on XP. The platform does not start. Here is the error.\nJRE is already installed. I guess it can\u0027t find boot path but i don\u0027t know \nwhat boot path is and how to fix it. thanks.\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Aug 03, 2004 10:27:11.187\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not find framework\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:355)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:172)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:644)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:628)",
    "How did you install Eclipse? Extracting on top of an existing install is\nnot supported, and usually causes problems. Was this the case?",
    "Hi,\n\nI got the same error on windows 2000 SP 4\nI unpached eclipse to c:\\eclipse-SDK-3.0-win32\\ and start c:\\eclipse-SDK-3.0-\nwin32\\eclipse\\exclipse.exe. What\u0027s wrong ?",
    "you need to supply more info like what VM etc etc.  It must be some sort of \nlocal configuration issue as about 75% of the Eclipse team runs on XP so \nclearly it works.",
    "Hi,\n\nVM version: 1.4.2._05 (downloaded from\nhttps://jsecom15b.sun.com/ECom/EComActionServlet/LegalPage:~:com.sun.sunit.sdlc.\ncontent.LegalWebPageInfo;jsessionid\u003djsecom15b.sun.com-4497%3A4118a009%\n3Ad421d98446f3871). I tryed with 1.4.1 VM but I got the same errors, so I guess \nit\u0027s not the problem of VM. This cannot be a problem of firewall (at work), \nbecause I\u0027ve also couldn\u0027t start the programm at home (XP Windows). I \ndownloaded Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php (only SDK \nexclipse), do I need some other downloads ?",
    "As far as I know we have only been using 1.4.2_04.  Rafael, can you see if you \ncan get 1.4.2_05 (through proper channels) and confirm it runs?  Someone around \nyou may already have it (e.g., JDT guys).  We want to ensure it runs for 3.0.1.",
    "I ran with 1.4.2_05 with no problems. Tomasz, are you running with the -vm\noption? The -vm option allows one to ensure which VM is being used to run\nEclipse. If you are not doing this already, please run Eclipse like this:\n\neclipse.exe [\u003cany arguments you already pass to Eclipse\u003e] -vm\n\u003cJAVA_HOME\u003e\\jre\\bin\\java.exe [-vmargs \u003cany arguments you already pass to the VM\u003e]\n\nThe sections in brackets are optional and are intended only to show you where\nthe -vm option should go w.r.t. any existing arguments you may already be using.",
    "I tried adding the -vm argument but it still does not work.\nAny other suggestions? Thanks...akhil\n",
    "Please run the following command:\n\ndir \u003ceclipse_install\u003e /s \u003e tree.txt\n\nand attach the resulting file to this PR. I suspect this is a duplicate of bug\n35718 (not preserving directory structure when extracting install).",
    "Akhil/Tomasz, could you do what is requested on comment 8?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d13864)\nsee comment 8\n\nHi, here the \"tree.txt\" file.",
    "Which tool did you use to extract Eclipse? For some reason, it changed all\ndirectory names to be upper-case. Winzip does not seem to behave like that. I\ncould easily reproduce the very same problem you are having by changing the case\nof a plug-in (org.eclipse.osgi) directory.",
    "Thanks a lot :-) Now it is working.",
    "Thomasz, do you understand how the folders got all caps? Akhil, was your problem\nthe same?",
    "Thanks a lot, Rafael. It is fine now...akhil",
    "That is great, but it would be really interesting if we knew what caused the\nproblem. For instancee, what tool did you guys use to extract the Eclipse zip\nfile? Thanks.",
    "Closing as invalid.",
    "Hi, I\u0027m using an old version of norton commander. I thing I need an update :-)"
