    "RAC README doc doesn\u0027t explain that config.jar is needed to run SetConfig.sh,\nnor how to build it.\nTo generate config.jar, I went to\nplatform/org.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller/src-config\n\nand ran:\njavac org/eclipse/tptp/platform/agentcontroller/config/*.java\njar -cvf config.jar org/eclipse/tptp/platform/agentcontroller/config/*.class\n\n\nwhich seemed to generate the proper config.jar, but when running SetConfig.sh,\nthe program fails with the followin error:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at java.util.StringTokenizer.\u003cinit\u003e(StringTokenizer.java:146)\n        at java.util.StringTokenizer.\u003cinit\u003e(StringTokenizer.java:162)\n        at\norg.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller.config.TestJvm.isMinimumVersion(TestJvm.java:53)\n        at\norg.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller.config.SetConfig.main(SetConfig.java:33)\n\n\nthe config.jar file from the .zip archive from the download area works just fine.\n\nAm I doing something wrong?\nCould this the build process to get config.sh be documented? \n\nFWIW:\njava version \"1.4.2_08\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_08-b03)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_08-b03, mixed mode)\n\n\nTIA,\n\nGuillaume J.

    "I propose, as 9 bis):\nImport in Eclipse workbench the Java project located at\ndev.eclipse.org\\home\\tptp\\platform\\org.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller/\nto build the source in the sub-directory src-config/\nThen export that plugin as a JAR file named config.jar that you will copy to\n\u003cworking\u003e/\u003cbuild ID\u003e/collection/packaging/lib\nThat JAR will be used by the SetConfig.sh script that you will run later on.\n\n...\n\nAs a side note, I\u0027d be more that happy if it was possible to build config.jar on\ncommand line only, but that\u0027s probably less important.",
    "(In reply to comment #2)\n\u003e I propose, as 9 bis):\n\u003e Import in Eclipse workbench the Java project located at\n\u003e dev.eclipse.org\\home\\tptp\\platform\\org.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller/\n\u003e to build the source in the sub-directory src-config/\n\u003e Then export that plugin as a JAR file named config.jar that you will copy to\n\u003e \u003cworking\u003e/\u003cbuild ID\u003e/collection/packaging/lib\n\u003e That JAR will be used by the SetConfig.sh script that you will run later on.\n\nThat text is not really accurate... I\u0027d prefer the following:\n\n9 bis):\n Import in Eclipse workbench the Java project located at\ndev.eclipse.org\\home\\tptp\\platform\\org.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller/\nYou will need to have either the SDK of TPTP or the projects that\norg.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller depends on so that the compilation can\ngo though.\n Then export that plugin as a \"Deployable pluggins and fragments\", and save it\nin a directory.\nIn that directory, you will find a file named config.jar that you need to copy\nto \u003cworking\u003e/\u003cbuild ID\u003e/collection/packaging/lib\n That JAR will be used by the SetConfig.sh script that you will run later on to\nconfigure the RAC.",

    "Untargeting this bugzilla until there is enough information to make a change.\n\nThe RAC readme is located here, but has no reference to a SetConfig.sh:\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/*checkout*/platform/org.eclipse.tptp.platform.agentcontroller/src-native/collection/README.txt?rev\u003dHEAD\u0026cvsroot\u003dTPTP_Project\u0026content-type\u003dtext/plain\n\nThe RAC getting started guide is located here, and has a reference to\nSetConfig.sh, but this document has nothing to do with building the RAC:\nhttp://eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/installguide/AgentController40.html\n\n",
