    "I was using RC3 and doing hyades development, hyades wasn\u0027t installed in my\nplugins but the hyades projects were open in my workspace.  The workspace I was\nusing was originally produced by the M9 build if that\u0027s any help.  The null\npointer occured during one of a long series of debugging sessions I had been\nrunning, the backtrace was\n\n$ java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaBreakpoint.installableReferenceType(JavaBreakpoint.java:318)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaBreakpoint.handleClassPrepareEvent(JavaBreakpoint.java:276)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaBreakpoint.handleEvent(JavaBreakpoint.java:256)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.EventDispatcher.dispatch(EventDispatcher.java:137)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.EventDispatcher.run(EventDispatcher.java:221)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)\n\nafter the backtrace I cannot be sure but the debugging session seemed to stall,\nthe runtime-workbench continued to refresh but actions would no longer have any\neffect.  I tried terminating the runtime-workbench and debugging again a number\nof times but again the application would go unresponsive in certain areas, it\noccurs to me that the unresponsive areas may of been in the same spots as some\ndisabled Breakpoints but I can\u0027t confirm that either way the exact spot the\nprogram grew unresponsive varied, the state of the debugging window didn\u0027t\nreflect having hit any kind of breakpoint.  I shut down the program after noting\nthe Null Pointer did show up once more later on (important to note that I\ndebugged many times before and after with out the null pointer).  The problem\nappears to have desisted when I restarted eclipse.\n\nI\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t give steps to reproduce but felt I might as well give what I\nhave, I\u0027ll continue to play around with it and update this report if I find any\nmore info.",

    "This implies a class prepare event was delivered from the target VM with \na \"null\" reference type. According to the JDI spec, this is not an expected \ncondition. Steps to reproduce would be valuable.\n\nFor now, marking as defered. Does not seem like a common occurrence.",
