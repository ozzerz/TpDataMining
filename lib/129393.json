    "Build: TPTP-4.2.0-200602230100\nMachine: Linux ppc64\n\nJunit test hung at 54%. No file is deploy at remote machine.",
    "\nAs far as I know, no test code has changed.  Assigning to platform, Samson, please take a look, any RAC/IAC changes lately?  This is the same symptom that was reported, then was closed because it went away and now its back again.",
    "Cindy, can you check if the file server is running by looking for port 10005 in the \"netstat -a -p tcp\" listing? Thanks.\n",
    "by executing the netstat -a -p command: \n\ntcp        0      0 *:10005                 *:*                     LISTEN\n15182/RAServer",
    "The Junit Test hungs at 54% on AS400 platform as well.",
    "Is it working on other platforms? There has been an Eclipse Platform problem in M5 that caused a problem very similar to this.\n",
    "It works fine at all other platforms, excepting the AS400 and the Linux ppc64.",
    "I have tried the TPTP-4.2.0-200602262249 driver on iSeries and it works. The test files are deployed successfully and the JUnit test case runs fine.\n",
    "I tried the TPTP-4.2.0-200602262249 driver on the Linux ppc platform. It works fine. However, I also tried the TPTP-4.2.0-200602262249 driver on the AS400 platform. It hungs at 54%.",
    "As Samson advised, I chenged to use the sun jdk1.4.2. It works on AS400. The jdk I used before is IBM jdk:\n\nC:\\ibmJava142\\bin\u003ejava -version\njava version \"1.4.2\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2)\nClassic VM (build 1.4.2, J2RE 1.4.2 IBM Windows 32 build cn142-20050929 (SR3) (J\nIT enabled: jitc))",
    "Lower the severity to major with agreement from originator. This only happens if the Eclipse is running under IBM JDK 1.4.2 and not Sun JDK 1.4.2. Futher investigateion will follow. Also this only happens when performing a Windows-\u003eiSeries test deployment.\n",
    "I noticed the same hanging at 54% when deploying when executing a URLTest.  I am using the following JDK for the workbench:\n\njava version \"1.5.0\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build pwi32dev-20051104)\nIBM J9 VM (build 2.3, J2RE 1.5.0 IBM J9 2.3 Windows XP x86-32 j9vmwi3223-20051103 (JIT enabled)\nJ9VM - 20051027_03723_lHdSMR\nJIT  - 20051027_1437_r8\nGC   - 20051020_AA)\nJCL  - 20051102\n\n\nI start eclipse with \"eclipse -consolelog\" and found this exception (occuring over and over) in the console log:\n\n\nException in thread \"org.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.task.ReusableThread@3e703e70\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.util.AgentControllerDescriptor.versionIsAtLeast(AgentControllerDescriptor.java:67)\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.util.AgentControllerDescriptor.isVersionAtLeast(AgentControllerDescriptor.java:194)\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.file.FileManagerFactory$3.run(FileManagerFactory.java:414)\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.task.ReusableThread.run(ReusableThread.java:131)\n        at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:788)\n",
    " I did the Junit testing with TPTP-4.2.0-200602281515 using ibmJava 1.4.2. It works fine.",
    "\nCindy, please close if this is no longer an issue, thanks!",
    "Cindy, please close if this is no longer an issue, thanks!",
    "\nCindy, please close if this is no longer an issue, thanks!",
    "According to the originator, switching the JDK on the workbench side to Sun will solve the problem. That indicates that the problem is not within the RAC but instead the communication between workbench and RAC.",
    "It works now - according to the originator.",
    "Ran Junit tests on Linuxppc64 and AS400 platforms using dirver 4.2.0.v200604060100. \nC:\\ibmJava142\\bin\u003ejava -version\njava version \"1.4.2\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2)\nClassic VM (build 1.4.2, J2RE 1.4.2 IBM Windows 32 build cn142-20050929 (SR3)\n\n  There was no this error any more."
