    "In the interest of bugzilla bookkeeping, I\u0027m marking all the old RBD bugs as \"won\u0027t fix\" since no further maintenance is planned for that component. \n\nIf you still have some issues with database tools I suggest you use and open bugs against the Eclipse DTP Project. \n\nWe do appreciate you helping us by opening the bug, though, and apologize it was not able to be resolved in a better and more timely manner. \n\n\n "
