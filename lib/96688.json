    "I was working on a Swing GUI program using a JPanel visual class and suddenly \nVE stopped rendering my GUI in the top half of the split screen editor.

I created a Java visual \nclasses extending JFrame but nothing is displayed in the WYSIWYG editor, the \nJavaBeans view, or the Properties view of the Java perspective. Next I added a \nmain method that instantiated the class. Still nothing. Next I removed \"extends \nJFrame\" from the class definition, created a JFrame instance variable, and \ninstantiated it in the initialize() method. This seems to work because I now \nsee the GUI in the WYSIWYG editor and I see the JFrame instance as the top node \nin the JavaBeans view. \n\nI read the Eclipse documentation for VE and I followed the guidelines for \ncreating a new visual class, but whenever I choose to extend another Swing \ncomponent the WYSIWYG editor displays nothing and the JavaBeans and Properties \nviews are empty. If I create a new visual class without extending a Swing \ncomponent, I can drag and drop a JFrame instance from the palette onto the \ncanvas and it displays correctly. Then I can continue to build my GUI using the \nvisual tools. This is not what the documentation says to do but it seems to \nwork.\n\nI also tried to run some of the Swing visual class examples included with VE. \nNone of these displayed correctly in the WYSIWYG editor or JavaBeans and \nProperties views. In fact, the text editor example crashed my computer! This is \nthe second time that this has happened to me using VE. VE is a very promising \nEclipse feature and I would like to continue to use it. If you have any further \nadvice I am still interested in resolving this problem. For the moment I will \nhave to use the workaround I found by not extending another Swing class in my \napplication.\n\nIan",

    "Try installing VE 1.0.2.  I think this looks like the conflict that occurs with\nhaving the EMF examples plug-in installed with VE \u003c 1.0.2.",

Thanks to you VE is working again and I\u0027m able to continue building my \nSwing application. This is a fine tool and I\u0027m glad to be able to use it. Many \nthanks.",
