    "Build ID: I20070625-1500\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1.  Create a plugin that uses the CDT\u0027s managed builder extensions with a configuration/toolchain hierarchy\n2.  In one of your base-class toolchains \"forget\" to assign a \nbuilder.\n3.  Create a project with your new toolchain/builder configuration.\n4.  Try to access the build properties of said project.\n\n\nMore information:\nThe error I get everytime is:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.jface 4 2 2007-07-21 01:14:16.468\n!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: \"org.eclipse.jface\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.internal.core.Configuration.getBuilderForInternalBuilderEnablement(Configuration.java:2061)\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.internal.core.Configuration.canEnableInternalBuilder(Configuration.java:2036)\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.properties.BuilderSettingsTab.updateButtons(BuilderSettingsTab.java:136)\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.properties.BuilderSettingsTab.updateData(BuilderSettingsTab.java:275)\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.ui.newui.AbstractCPropertyTab.setVisible(AbstractCPropertyTab.java:198)\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.managedbuilder.ui.properties.BuilderSettingsTab.setVisible(BuilderSettingsTab.java:334)\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.ui.newui.AbstractCPropertyTab.handleTabEvent(AbstractCPropertyTab.java:507)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d74289)\nSimple proposed solution\n\nAttached is my proposed fix for this bug.\n\nThis is my first bug report, so please let me know if I\u0027ve done something wrong.\n\n-Patrick",
    "Actually the builder is a required element currently. How would the Build System decide which builder to use if there is no one specified?\nSo the problem you are seeing is caused by the buggy tool-chain definition.\n\nBasically we could allow tool-chain definitions to NOT specify the builder. In this case the \"default\" builder could be chosen automatically.\nThis could be the \"Internal Builder\" for \"managed\" projects and \"make\" builder for \"makefile\" projects.\n\nI\u0027ll update the bug summary to mostly reflect the problem as I\u0027m seeing it and will mark the bug as \"enhancement\".\n\nThanks,\nMikhail",
    "(In reply to comment #2)\nMikhail, thanks very much for your reply.  Please forgive me for digging a bit deeper into this.\n\nIt does seem to me to be a bug when I get an ugly NullPointer exception.\n\nI realize that toolchains are meant to have builders associated with them.  I also appreciate your willingness to amend that requirement, that is an excellent long-term solution to this \"problem\" (if it can be called that).  \n\nWhat I was looking for though was more of a way for the CDT to protect itself from users who do not know/remember to put one in.  Should their projects throw a NullPointerException, or should the CDT degrade nicely.  The patch I submitted is just simply a null pointer check that should arguably be there already.\n\nTo your question \"How would the Build System decide which builder to use if there is no one specified?\" I would agree that would be a real issue if the toolchain in question here weren\u0027t an abstract base class one.  An abstract toolchain, at least, should be especially relieved of these requirements as it is guaranteed it will never be instantiated.\n\nJust some things to consider,\n\nThanks again for your reply,\n\n-Patrick",
    "Sorry, didn\u0027t mean to switch severity back to normal -- I\u0027ll let you do that if you see fit.\n\n-Patrick"
