    "A new feature discussed at EclipseCon and \u003ca href\u003d\"http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/GMF_New_and_Noteworthy#Graphdef_visual_editor_.28org.eclipse.gmf.graphdef.editor.29_enhanced\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e indicate it\u0027s possible to enhance generation through use of an extension model and custom templates.  However, there is no \"nice\" way of adding these extension model elements to the gmfgen model at present.\n\nPerhaps the wizard that transforms the gmfmap model into the gmfgen model can have a place to add these customization models, to go along with new provisional dynamic templates field?",
    "Related bug #181844",
    "As a first try, I\u0027d stick to a separate action (registered against .gmfgen), which pops up a dialog to select an EMF model (.ecore), asks for metaclass to instantiate and adds new eObject instance to the eResource.contents.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d63889)\n\"Add extension model...\" context action with common-styled wizard added\n\n",
    "(From update of attachment 63889)\n1.

No need to allow for target encoding change.\n\n3. Would be convenient to avoid two poorly populated pages.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d64114)\nAction is completely rewritten\n\nAction is completely rewritten to use standard wizard page from org.eclipse.gmf.bridge.ui module. Minor convinience tuning had to be added to org.eclipse.gmf.common as well.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d64119)\nTerribly sorry, I have forgotten to include one more class to the previous patch!\n\n",
    "reviewed, slightly refactored and committed."
