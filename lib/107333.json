    "OS : Linux \nNot must fix \nBuild date:09/08 \nBlocking: NO \nLanguage: DEU \nBitmap Location: V:\\defects\\de\\Initialization.jpg \nTester Name: Ruth Nestvold \n\nProblem Description: When starting Eclipse from the command line in Linux with \na corrupted project using Java Tools, an error message appears in English, \"An \ninternal error occurred during:\" \nThis string needs to be localized in the next version. \n\nSee the attached screen shot.\n\nWhen I was opening the defect, I forgot to mention that the date formate in \nthe error panel also is not localized. See the information in top right-hand \ncorner of the screen shot.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d26239)\nInitialization.jpg\n",
    "Could you please provide the whole stack trace?",
    "If you could provide steps to reproduce, I could try to localize this message. I\ntried some text search so far in vain.\nThanks.",
    "This error seems to come from the message jobs_internalError in the file\norg/eclipse/core/internal/runtime/messages.properties in the plugin\norg.eclipse.core.runtime_3.1.0.jar.\nMove to Platform/Runtime for comments.",
    "I agree with comment #4 - the message comes from that property file. Can the\ntester confirm if that message is present in the translated version of that file\nbeing tested?",
    "Yes, the message is translated in German:\njobs_internalError\u003dW\\u00e4hrend \\\"{0}\\\" ist ein interner Fehler aufgetreten.",
    "I tried with German locale and I got:\nW?hrend \"Java-Tools werden initialisiert\" ist ein interner Fehler aufgetreten.\n\nFrom the .log file I get:\n!MESSAGE W?hrend \"Java-Tools werden initialisiert\" ist ein interner Fehler\naufgetreten.\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.core.JavaCore$1.run(JavaCore.java:2715)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:76)\n\nSo it looks ok.\nI would close as INVALID.",
    "The time stamp look like: 2005-08-18 17:27:39.765\nNot sure this is nls\u0027d.",
    "I don\u0027t know what else we can do with this bug... a manual inspection found that\nthe message is translated, and testing here with the German catalog found the\ntranslated message appearing correctly in the UI.  Closing.  Please reopen if\nyou can reproduce with the 3.1.1 release or newer.",
    "Close problem."
