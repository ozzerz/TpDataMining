    "I believe this is really related to the RCP SDK as I see the this exact message\nafter simply downloading the RCP SDK, unzipping it, and launching eclipse.exe on\nWindows XP.  Eclipse RCP SDK version is 3.0 final.",
    "*** Bug 68728 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "As Todd mentions, this is the message that you will get if you try and start up\nthe Eclipse RCP. The RCP is intended as a framework and does not include an\napplication. Please download the SDK.",
    "I\u0027m getting this error message using eclipse-SDK-3.0-linux-gtk.zip. I\u0027ve just\nchecked the MD5 sum to make sure I\u0027m using the correct download archive.\n\nI don\u0027t think this one is the RCP SDK, or is it?",
    "That file should be the full SDK. The easiest way to check is to look in the\n\"eclipse/plugins\" directory. In the RCP SDK there are substantially fewer plugins.\n\nAlso, did you unzip the new file over-top the old install or first remove the\nold install (or install to a new dir)?",
    "I see 83 plugin subdirectories in plugins/, so I really think this is the normal\nSDK.\n\nAs for the installation, I did a completely fresh install, with no plugins at\nall. I was trying to use my old workspace from 3.0 RC3, though.",
    "are you running some sort of shared install where you have a config directory \nlocal to your user (you are on linux right?)?  If so, go in there and rename \nthe config.ini file.  (actually, unless you have some dear preferences, I would \njust rename the whole directory).  \n\nNote also that the original report was not on 3.0.  The build date was 06/19.  \n3.0 is 06/25",
    "Actually, I seem to have two config.ini files:\n\n- .eclipse/.config/config.ini\n- .eclipse/configuration/config.ini\n\nBoth are the same (content-wise) and look mostly empty. I\u0027m attaching a copy so\nyou can have a look.\n\nPlease advise if those are the files you want me to rename, and if so, which one\nto rename.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d12861)\nconfig.ini file\n",
    "looks old.  also looks like it is not the problem.  the .config dir can be \ndeleted.  It is very obsolete.  \nActually, at this point I would recommend trying to delete (rename) the entire \nconfiguration dir as well.  A number of things have changed over the course of \n3.0 development (and some very recently).  ",
    "Whoa, I mean... Can that really be the only cure? Like I\u0027ve said, I\u0027ve used that\nworkspace and configuration successfully with 3.0 RC3, so I\u0027m kind of surprised\nthat it no longer works with 3.0 final. Of course I don\u0027t want to lose all my\nsettings, too.",
    "did it work?\n\nyou won\u0027t lose all your settings.   Most of them are in your workspace.  A few \nare in the config area.  If it turns out to be really problematic, some \nskillfull directory copying may solve the problem for you.\n\nThis is not a normal situation and yes, somethings did change right at the \nend.  We have not heard of problems in this transition from other people on the \nteam so it may be something unique to your setup.  ",
    "I haven\u0027t tried yet since that is on my work machine, and I\u0027m at home now again.\nI will try the steps you mentioned tomorrow morning.",

If it\u0027s not intended to,\nis the only difference between the RCP binary and SDK downloads the inclusion of\nsource code?",
    "You are correct, the only difference between the RCP binary and SDK drops is the\ninclusion of source.\n\nThere is a good description under the RCP binary download on the downloads page.\nIt states that it is a target for RCP apps.\n\nMost people will end up using the general Eclipse SDK for development and set\ntheir target platform to be an install of the RCP download.",
