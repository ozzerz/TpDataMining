    "Using the TPTP 3.3 20050509_0816 build, remote log import with filters fails on \nLinux/ia32, HP, Solaris and AIX.  The following error message is issued from \nthe Log Import wizard:\n\nIWAT0030E An error occurred during the execution of the remote log \nparser \"org.eclipse.hyades.logging.adapter.config.StaticParserWrapper\": \nIWAT0369E The adapter configuration file GLA42171.adapter cannot be found.\n\nWith TPTP 3.3 20050501_1719 build, remote log import with filters works fine \nwith no errors.\n\nThis problem could be related to the change made recently to the RAC File \nServer support (see bugzilla 75002) since it appears the adapter file was not \ntransferred to the remote system.",
    "This must be fixed for 3.3",
    "Reducing the severity of this problem because with current drivers \n(20050510_0200) the problem is intermittent.",
    "Hi Dave,\n\nCan you please add the steps necessary to reproduce this problem?  We are \nmaknig good progress on the other issues and hope to get to this problem soon.\n\nThanks,\n--Joe",
    "Joe, I am transferring this to you because it looks like a file transfer \nproblem.\n\nWe have traced this problem to a file transfer failure not being returned.  The \ncall to fileManager.putFile(sourceFile, targetFile); sometimes does not throw \nan exception when it fails.  In the remote import with filter scenario, the \nclient workbench tries to send the GLA adapter file containing the filter blade \nto the remote system.  However, it does not know what OS is running on the \nremote system so first tries to transfer the file to c:\\ on the remote \nmachine.  If that fails, it assumes the machine is non-Windows and tries to \ntransfer the file to /tmp.  If putFile does not throw an exception when trying \nto transfer the file to c:\\ on a non-Windows machine, it assumes the transfer \nwas successful and continues with the import operation which obviously fails \nbecause the adapter file is not there.  This is the problem we are encountering.\n\nThe putFile call is made in \norg.eclipse.hyades.log.ui.internal.util.GLAFilterHelper.sendAdapter method.\n\nTo reproduce this problem:\n\n1) Start the RAC on a remote system.\n2) Start eclipse with TPTP on your workstation.\n3) In Eclise, select File-\u003eImport...-\u003eLog file and click Next.\n4) Click on Add... button in Log Files window to add a log file to import.\n5) Select the log file type from the list at the top of the window.  Then Add \nthe host name of the remote system to the Host list and select it in the Host \nname tab.\n6) Select the Details tab and fill in the fields for the specific log file.\n7) Select the Filter tab and and click New... to add a filter\n8) Click OK to select the default when asked to select the type of filter.\n9) Check the Filter by Events box on the Standard tab in the Edit Filter \nwindow.  Leave the remaining fields with the default values. Click OK.\n10) Click OK and then Finish to start the import.\n11) If the import fails you will see an error dialog with a message saying the \nadapter file cannot be found.\n\nAs I indicated before, this is an intermittent problem.  Sometimes the import \nsucceeds.  Also, sometimes when running in a runtime workbench the import \nsucceeds but an error is still displayed.  The following exception is displayed \nin the development workbench console:\n\njava.net.SocketException: Socket is closed\n\tat java.net.Socket.getOutputStream(Socket.java:761)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.ConnectionImpl.sendMessage\n(ConnectionImpl.java:290)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.file.FileManagerExtendedImpl.queryFileServerL\nocation(FileManagerExtendedImpl.java:421)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.file.FileManagerExtendedImpl.\u003cinit\u003e\n(FileManagerExtendedImpl.java:79)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.file.FileManagerFactory.create\n(FileManagerFactory.java:75)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.hyades.log.ui.internal.util.GLAFilterHelper.deleteTempAdapter\n(GLAFilterHelper.java:478)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.hyades.log.ui.internal.wizards.ImportLogWizard$RemoteLogImportJob.ru\nn(ImportLogWizard.java:1263)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66)\n\nThis exception occurs when the temporary adapter file is being deleted from the \nremote system after the import has completed.",
