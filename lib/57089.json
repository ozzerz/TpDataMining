    "Cherie, although you fixed one problem, you did not address Nick\u0027s specific \ncomplaint.\n\nNick, the + was there all along.  You just had to widen the + column and you \nhave seen this nested +.\n\nSince there is no maximum depth limit on the log subentries, there is really \nno getting around possible hidden +\u0027s.  That is why, as a visual indicator, we \nnow bold all entries that have children.  This is the best visual cue we could \ncome up with to tell you that this entry is expandable and if the + is not \nvisible then you need to widen the column.",
    "There was no hidden + and the item was not bold.\nOther items in the log did have a visible + and were bold.\n",

The patch\nallowed for the rest of the message to be visible in the message line and in\nthe message area of the Event Details Dialog.  \n\nWassim is right in that I had to expand the first column to see all the +\u0027s\n(hence the red rectangle), but the first two entries were bolded to indicate\nthey had subentries.  Does this not happen for you?\n\nIf the latest code from head does not strike your fancy, please let me know :)\n",
