    "Build date: 31/03/06\nOS: RHEL 4.0\n\nDescription:\n\nWhen selecting the \"Select Data\" tab in the \"Edit Chart\" window (double click on the Chart created in the attached \"test.rptdesign\" to open the \"Edit Chart\" window), an error occurs and the view is disabled, however when switching to another tab (as \"Format Chart\"), and returning back to the \"Select Chart\" tab it opens without generating problems.\n\n\nSteps to recreate the problem:\n\n1)Import the attached \"test.rptdesign\" to any Report project\n2)Double click on the Chart created in the \"test.rptdesign\" report. In the edit chart window, select the \"Select Data\" tab.\n\nExpected output:\n\nThe \"Select data\" tab should open without any problems.\n\nActual output:\n\nThe \"Select data\" tab doesn\u0027t open, and an error occurs. \"BIRTFig1.jpg\" shows the displayed message box, and \"logfile.txt\" shows the errors in the errorlog view. \n\nN.B: This problem occurs only on Arabic-Egypt locale, it works fine with English-US locale.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d37516)\nScreen capture for the error message\n\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d37517)\nlogfile which shows all errors displayed in the error log view\n\n",

    "Works for me.\nI suspect it\u0027s caused by invalid dataset.",
    "The first exception is due to odbc the driver:\n\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver.initialize(JdbcOdbcDriver.java:472)\n\tat sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver.connect(JdbcOdbcDriver.java:189)\n\tat java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:540)\n\tat java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection(DriverManager.java:155)",
    "I couldn\u0027t reproduce the issue either, even with the arabic-egypt locale, using \nthe same report and the same driver (althouth I tested on Windows). Can you \ncheck if you can preview the report with a table (no chart) in this locale? I \nalso think that might be a data issue, rather than a chart problem.",
    "please see comment #6",
    "(In reply to comment #6)\n\u003e I couldn\u0027t reproduce the issue either, even with the arabic-egypt locale, using \n\u003e the same report and the same driver (althouth I tested on Windows). Can you \n\u003e check if you can preview the report with a table (no chart) in this locale? I \n\u003e also think that might be a data issue, rather than a chart problem.\n\nDavid,\n\n1) This defect occurs on Linux only.\n2) The problem is in the \"Edit Chart\" window not in the report preview.\n3) You must have a chart in your report, the problem occurs when dealing with charts.\n\nI have attached another screen capture to the error. I hope it is more illustrative.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d38525)\nnew screen capture for the error message\n\n",
    "This is a data driver issue on linux as the log shows. I googled \n\"java.lang.NullPointerException sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver.initialize\" and \nfound that this is a recurring problem on Linux when trying to use the jdbcodbc \ndriver. I reassign to Data Access team to provide assistance on this issue.",
    "Severity increased,  we are expecting a fix in this release",
    "As commented by David, this bug exists when JdbcOdbc driver is used in Linux environment. I have changed to throw an OdaException instead of NullPointerException, because OdaException could be caught by the caller and then the caller have chance to process it. Reassign to Chart team for further enhancement if needed.",
    "Chart didn\u0027t change anything since Exception has been caught by the error dialog to indicate what happened",
    "(In reply to comment #13)\n\nVerified on RC2 build.  "
