    "WSAD profiling mode cannot find the file, java.policy, on the network drive. \nThe same appliation with the policy file placed on local drive, profiling works \nfine. \n\n1)Is this the java.policy file in the JRE?  Is the JRE on a network drive?\nThe file java.policy comes with JRE, but I move it to network drive for testing \npurpose. JRE is not on network drive.\n\n2) any error messages and where they occur\njava.security.AccessControlException: access denied    \n(java.io.FilePermission\nC:\\DATEN\\tks\\source\\acs\\config\\acsresources.ini read)      \nat      java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission\n(AccessControlContext.java:286)  \n\n3) steps to reproduce the problem\nProfile the program with following VM argument:\n-Djava.security.policy \u003dh:\\.java.policy\nh is network drive. (If h is local drive, there is no problem)\n\n4) What version of WSAD and RAC is the customer using \nWSAD5.0. \n\n5) What platform/OS is the WSAD and RAC running on?  Are they both running on \nthe same machine \nWindows NT4.0 SP6. WSAD and RAC are on the same machine.",
