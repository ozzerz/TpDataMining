    "I got this NPE when I created the Firefox makefile project, set the discovery profile scope to Per Resource and loaded a build log file. Another thing I noticed was that I could only select *Project* discovery profiles. I thought there were *Resource* profiles at one point.\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.cdt.make.internal.core.scannerconfig.jobs.SCJobsUtil$3.run(SCJobsUtil.java:191)\nat org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:37)\nat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.run(Platform.java:850)\nat org.eclipse.cdt.make.internal.core.scannerconfig.jobs.SCJobsUtil.readBuildOutputFile(SCJobsUtil.java:201)\nat org.eclipse.cdt.make.internal.core.scannerconfig.jobs.BuildOutputReaderJob.run(BuildOutputReaderJob.java:61)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)",
    "The exception occured because the given profile does not support the build output provider mechanism.\nThe issue is that the \"profile edit page\" contributed by the make.core seems to be displayed for all per-project profiles. This is definitely incorrect. the page should be displayed only for profiles that associated with the page.\nWe will also need to define the profile pages for the profiles defined in the managedbuilder.core.\n\nOleg, could you take a look into this?\n\n(In reply to comment #0)\n\u003e Another thing I\n\u003e noticed was that I could only select *Project* discovery profiles. I thought\n\u003e there were *Resource* profiles at one point.\nHi Doug,\n\nThe per-file profile mechanism is still there :)\nI guess we have a terminology issue here. Let me ellaborate on how the discovery mechanism works for the CDT Build system project now:\nThe discovery mechanism is currently used in two modes:\n1. \"Per-resource _type_\" mode - is the mode when different profiles can be asssociated with different resource _types_ (different tools/input types), this allows, having different settings dixcovered, e.g. for C and C++ source files. This mode also allows to have different profile settings for different folders.\nOnly \"project\" profile types are allowed with this mode currently.\n2. \"Configuration-wide\" mode - is the mode when only one profile (one IScannerConfigBuilderInfo2 setting) is used for discovering scanner info for the whole project/configuration. This is the mode simple to the one was in MBS 3.x and Standard Make 3.x\nWith this mode both \"project\" and \"per-file\" discovery is allowed.\n\nI guess we should rename the \"Per-resource _type_\" to something more appropriate. What about the \"Per-language\"?\n\nThanks,\nMikhail",
    "Mikhail, please verify.\n",
    "I\u0027ve committed some additional fix for this.\nthe problem seems to be fixed now.\n\nMarking as FIXED..\n\nMikhail"
