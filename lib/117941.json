    "20051122\n\nI pasted some code into a java editor and got the following exception continually until I changed the focus\n\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2005-11-24 13:27:46.609\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Requesting Java AST from selection\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JavaEditor.updateOccurrenceAnnotations(JavaEditor.java:2917)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JavaEditor$6.selectionChanged(JavaEditor.java:2932)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.viewsupport.SelectionListenerWithASTManager$PartListenerGroup.calculateASTandInform(SelectionListenerWithASTManager.java:173)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.viewsupport.SelectionListenerWithASTManager$3.run(SelectionListenerWithASTManager.java:142)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\nI haven\u0027t found an easy way to replicate but I will post it when I can",
    "Did pasting the same code not bring the problem back?",
    "No - I did some clicking around to get out of the situation but that got me back into a consistent state",
    "Looks like once of the occurrence updater adds a null-node or the AST is corrupted. Without a test case this is hard to fix. We don\u0027t want to add a null-ceck at the error location because this would hide the problem.\n\nTod, did you check the .log?",
    "The log is where I got this trace from.",
    "OK, let\u0027s rephrase my question: was there some other entry near this one?",
    "Sorry Dani - I didn\u0027t see one as the .log was full of these errors.",
    "*** Bug 118904 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "*** Bug 119094 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Next time you see this please do the following:\n- don\u0027t move the caret and create a screenshot that contains the caret\n- attach the screenshot to this bug\n- click into the editor but make sure not to click inside some word/text\n- copy the content and attach it here",
    "Finaly got it myself and can now debug and fix.",
    "Found the bug: MethodExitFinder has trouble if the caret is near a return inside a constructor.\n\nFixed in HEAD.\nAvailable in builds \u003e 20051208-0010.",
    "Starting verification...",
    "Verified in I20051213-0010."
