    "Christian - could you provide more information about what you were doing when you saw the NPE? For example, how many aspects do you have? What do your aspects look like? Are you seeing this all the time? Was this after a full or incremental build? Are you using AspectJ RC1?\n\nJust as a note, the stack trace provided here is the same as that reported in bug 112529.",
    "I was browsing through the buglist but couldn\u0027t find any simular stacktrace. The bug you pointed to could be the same problem.\nEclipse shows Version of AspectJ as 1.5.0.20051011134207. Not sure whether that is also RC1 or RC2.\n\nThe bug has happened within Eclipse when I did a Clean on the Project with the Aspect AND on the Project where I have the classes on which the aspect is applied too. I only have ONE aspect defined (with several pointcuts and advices.\n\nI did a clean because I found that sometimes when I change an Aspect that not all classes that are using it are automatically recompiled. So to be on the save side I alway clean all affected projects manually.\n\nIt happened only ONCE so far and I have been working on it now for 2 days (not much but the aspect has already several pages)\n\nanything more ?\nchristian",
    "Thanks for responding so quickly :-)\n\n\u003e Version of AspectJ as 1.5.0.20051011134207\n\nI think this build of AspectJ is just after 1.5.0 M4 (M4 was released on 7th October). I know it\u0027s a pain, but would you be able to upgrade to the latest AJDT? This is AJDT 1.3.0 RC1 which includes AspectJ 1.5.0 RC1. The reason I ask is that bug 112529 was also raised against aspectj 1.5.0 M4 and Andy put a comment in there saying that he added some improved handling code on 14th october. This means that we can get more diagnostics if things go wrong for you in the lastest version. \n\nThanks, Helen",
    "yep... the error as reported can\u0027t happen in the current code base. That doesn\u0027t mean there might not be another issue lurking, but this exact problem is certainly nailed in RC1...",
    "Doesnt seem to be anything we can do on this bug right now.  So I\u0027m closing it - we can reopen if a similar problem manifests in the future."
