    "When I tried to install the Eclipse 3.0 M7 examples (eclipse-examples-\n3.0M7.zip) which I download from \nhttp://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse-\nexamples-3.0M7.zip, the examples were installed, but they were not loaded to \nthe workbench.\n\nHere are the steps to follow in order to regenerate this scenario\n1. Install Eclipse 3.0 M7 on Solaris 9 or HP-UX 11.11\n2. Download example archive eclipse-examples-3.0M7.zip from \nhttp://fullmoon.torolab.ibm.com/downloads/drops/S-3.0M7-200402122000/eclipse-\nexamples-3.0M7.zip\n3. Install the examples by following the instructions given in the download \npage. They are as follows:\n?To install the examples, first make sure you have exited your Eclipse \nprogram. Then download the zip file containing the examples and extract the \ncontents of the zip file to the same directory you used for your SDK \ninstallation. For example, if you installed the Eclipse Project SDK on \nd:\\eclipse-sdk then extract the contents of the examples zip file to \nd:\\eclipse-sdk. Start Eclipse. The example plug-ins will be installed.?\n4. Launch Eclipse.\nExpected Behavior: The examples are detected, installed and loaded to the \nworkbench. By selecting \u0027Window \u003e Show View \u003e Other \u003e SWT Examples\u0027 from the \nworkbench menu option, each individual example can be launched.\nActual Behavior: The examples are detected and installed, but never loaded to \nthe workbench. Therefore, the SWT Example category is not available in \nthe ?Show View? window. \n \nImportant: After browsing the Eclipse newsgroups, I found the fix for this bug \nin the following news article\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg13244.html\n\nThe fix given in this article is as follows:\n?Go to Help \u003e SoftwareUpdates \u003eManage Configuration and launch the \nConfiguration Dialog. Turn on disabled features filtering and then enable the \nexamples feature.?",
    "On Linux and Windows one can detect changes in a directory (new file added, \nfile removed, etc.) by checking the timestamp on the directory itself.\nIt appears that on Solaris and HP this assumption is incorrect.\nCould you confirm that if:\n- D is a directory \n- a new file N is added to the directory D, the timestamp on D is unchanged\n- a file R removed from D does not affect the timestamp on D either\n?\n\nIf that\u0027s the case, is there a quick way to detect directory changes (file \nadded/removed) without having to process all the directory contents?\n\nThanks",
    "I have performed the following steps on both Solaris 7 and 8 and HP-UX 11.11. I \nused ls -lia to verify dates.\n\nCreated a directory. Timestamp is time and date of creation.\nCreated a new file in that directory. Timestamp changes on the directory to the \nnew time when the file was created.\nRemoved the file. Timestamp on the directory changed again to the time that the \nfile was removed. \n\nMaybe the date format on Solaris and HP-UX is different than what it is on \nLinux and Windows. ",
    "Thanks!\nThe date format should not matter, we are using the java.util.Date class and \ncall getTime() to obtain the time in milliseconds and then do comparisons.\nI will try performing the suggested steps on Windows and see if that leads to \na problem. For now, I wanted to rule out any timestamp issues that could be OS \nspecific.",
    "We have made some significant changes to the eclipse startup and they will be \navailable in tomorrow\u0027s integration build.\nI tested the problem on Windows using nightly build 0222, and things seem to \nwork. Have you encountered the same problem with M7 on Windows?\nPlease pick up tomorrows integration build and give it a try, the problem may \nhave been solved already.",
    "I did experience the same problem with Eclipse 3.0M7 on Windows 2000.\nThe integration build I20040224 can not be run on Windows 2000, Solaris 9 and \nHP-UX 11.11, so I could not check whether this problem exists in that build. \nIf it helps, the following was the log entry (content of .log file) that I \nfound after the Eclipse I20040224 workbench was crashed.\n\n\n!SESSION ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Feb 24, 2004 10:45:05.967\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: \n\tThe import org.eclipse.ui.commands.CommandHandlerServiceFactory cannot \nbe resolved\n\tThe import org.eclipse.ui.commands.IMutableCommandHandlerService \ncannot be resolved\n\tThe import org.eclipse.ui.commands.IWorkbenchWindowCommandSupport \ncannot be resolved\n\tThe import org.eclipse.ui.contexts.IWorkbenchWindowContextSupport \ncannot be resolved\n\tThe import \norg.eclipse.ui.internal.commands.ws.WorkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be \nresolved\n\tThe import \norg.eclipse.ui.internal.contexts.ws.WorkbenchWindowContextSupport cannot be \nresolved\n\tIWorkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved (or is not a valid \ntype) for the field WorkbenchWindow.workbenchWindowCommandSupport\n\tIWorkbenchWindowContextSupport cannot be resolved (or is not a valid \ntype) for the field WorkbenchWindow.workbenchWindowContextSupport\n\tworkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved\n\tWorkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved or is not a type\n\tworkbenchWindowContextSupport cannot be resolved\n\tWorkbenchWindowContextSupport cannot be resolved or is not a type\n\tWorkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved or is not a type\n\tworkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved\n\tactionSetAndGlobalActionCommandHandlerService cannot be resolved\n\tIMutableCommandHandlerService cannot be resolved (or is not a valid \ntype) for the field \nWorkbenchWindow.actionSetAndGlobalActionCommandHandlerService\n\tCommandHandlerServiceFactory cannot be resolved\n\tactionSetAndGlobalActionCommandHandlerService cannot be resolved\n\tIWorkbenchWindowContextSupport cannot be resolved (or is not a valid \nreturn type) for the method getContextSupport\n\tworkbenchWindowContextSupport cannot be resolved\n\tIWorkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved (or is not a valid \nreturn type) for the method getCommandSupport\n\tworkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved\n\tIWorkbenchWindowCommandSupport cannot be resolved or is not a type\n\tThe method getCommandSupport() is undefined for the type \nWorkbenchWindow\n\tIWorkbenchWindowContextSupport cannot be resolved or is not a type\n\tThe method getContextSupport() is undefined for the type \nWorkbenchWindow\n\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow.\u003cinit\u003e\n(WorkbenchWindow.java:209)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.newWorkbenchWindow\n(Workbench.java:1149)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.openFirstTimeWindow\n(Workbench.java:1196)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.init(Workbench.java:912)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.runUI(Workbench.java:1520)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.createAndRunWorkbench\n(Workbench.java:263)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI.createAndRunWorkbench(PlatformUI.java:139)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.ide.IDEApplication.run\n(IDEApplication.java:47)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run\n(PlatformActivator.java:256)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run\n(EclipseStarter.java:100)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:279)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:742)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:581)",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d8180)\nA screenshot of the Product Configuration dialog\n",
    "When I installed Eclipse examples eclipse-examples-I20040225.zip on Eclipse \nIntegration Build I20040225 on Solaris 9 and HP-UX 11i as requested, I \nrealized that the examples were installed and loaded to the workbench once the \nEclipse was restarted. This is the expected behavior, therefore it is \nsuccessful.\n\nHowever, according to the product Configuration dialog (can be launched by \nselecting ?Help -\u003e Software Updates -\u003e Manage Configuration? from the main \nmenu) the ?Eclipse SDK Examples 3.0.0? was still disabled even though they \nwere loaded to the workbench and could be launched by selecting \u0027Window \u003e Show \nView \u003e Other \u003e SWT Examples\u0027 from the workbench menu. My guess is the Product \nConfiguration dialog was not updated to reflect the recent changes. \n\nA screenshot of the Product Configuration dialog is attached as \nproduct_configuration.jpg.",
    "We\u0027ll leave the bug open to investigate why the example features appear \ndisabled.",
    "Fixed in the latest integration build 0303.\nBTW, you should also be able to install the examples using the update manager \n(and no restart would even be needed). Right now the update site is \nexperimental only, but it should be available at some point.",
    "The defect that I mentioned in Additional Comment # 8 still exists in Eclipse \n3.0M9 Build (Build id: 200405211200) on Solaris 9.0 and HP-UX 11i platforms.\n\nThis time I installed the Eclipse Examples by simply extracting the example \nzip archive into the same folder that I used for the SDK installation and \nstarted the workbench. I could see the examples were installed and loaded even \nthough the Product Configuration Dialog (can be launched by selecting ?Help -\u003e \nSoftware Updates -\u003e Manage Configuration? from the main menu) stated that the \nEclipse SDK Examples were not (i.e. examples are disabled).",
    "Have you tried this on other OS\u0027es ? Was only Solaris and HP that failed?\nI don\u0027t have access to Solaris and HP, so could you please check the timestamp \non the eclipse/features, eclipse/plugins, \neclipse/feature/\u003cthe_example_feature\u003e and eclipse/plugins/\u003cthe_example_plugin\u003e \ndirectories?\nAlso, can you attach the content of eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.update \nfolder here?\nThanks!",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d11141)\nContent of eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.update directory\n",
    "I didn?t try this scenario on other OSes other than Solaris 9 and HP-UX 11i. \nSo, I am going to test it on Windows 2k now. I?ll let you know how it goes. In \nthe meantime, here are the timestamps that you requested. \n\neclipse/features: May 26 11:03\neclipse/plugins: May 26 11:03\neclipse/feature/\u003cthe_example_feature\u003e: May 21 12:54\neclipse/plugins/\u003cthe_example_plugin\u003e: May 21 12:54\n\nI also attached the content of eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.update \ndirectory to this defect. Note that I have enabled the example feature from \nProduct Configuration Dialog before the content of \neclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.update directory was extracted.",
    "I tested it on Windows 2000 platform. This defect was not reproducible. I guess \nthe example installation failure only happens on Solaris and HP-UX platforms. \nDo you want me to test this on Linux as well?",
    "Thanks!\nHere what I think it happens:\n\nWhen you unzip the examples, the timestamp of the eclipse/features and \neclipse/plugins directory changes (and it should). This triggers the update \nconfigurator to reconcile the configuration with what has been unzipped.\nThe configurator checks the timestamp on each feature directory, looking for \none that is newer than the old configuration. However, the unzip has not \ncorrectly created the timestamps, likely because it preserves those from the \norginal zip file.\nAs such, the feature does not appear in the platform.xml file (it only appears \nafter you enable it).\n\nWith plugins, the story is a bit different: for performance reasons, the \nupdate policy (check platform.xml) is USER-EXCLUDE, which is empty, so all the \nplugins from that site are picked up, including the newly unzipped plugins \n(even though they have an older timestamp).\n\nBTW, if you have a chance, please test on Linux as well, so at least we have a \nmore comlete picture of where things fail.\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d11161)\nContent of eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.update directory on Linux\n",
    "I experienced the same problem when I tried to install the Eclipse examples on \nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3.0. Note that there are two different example zip \narchives available on the Eclipse Download Page. One of them is for the Windows \nfamily and the other is for the rest of the supported platforms. May be the \nWindows version of the example zip archive does not cause this problem, but the \nother one does. That may be why this issue is not reproducible on Windows \nplatforms. \n\nHere are the timestamps that you requested.\neclipse/features: May 26 12:20\neclipse/plugins: May 26 12:20\neclipse/feature/\u003cthe_example_feature\u003e: May 21 12:30\neclipse/plugins/\u003cthe_example_plugin\u003e: May 21 12:54\n  \nI also attached the content of eclipse/configuration/org.eclipse.update \ndirectory to this defect (see org.eclipse.update_RHLinuxEnt3.0.zip file). \n\nLet me know if you need further assistance.",
    "Thanks for help!\nI think the problem is clear, the timestamp from inside the zip is carried \nover on the plugins directories. \n",
    "Installing features should be done via the update standalone commands or via \nthe update ui.\nAnything that is manually downloaded is tolerated (plugins are picked up), but \nnot fully integrated. The user must manually enable those features in the \nconfiguration manager. The fact that it works on Windows, is a side-effect \nthat benefits those users.\nI will close this bug as wontfix."
