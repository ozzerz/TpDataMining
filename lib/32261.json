    "Posted this to news group, and was asked to log this. Basically, if an error is\nthrown inside a synchronized section, the debugger says the error is on the line\nthat has the synchronized modifer. Try running the following code:\n\npublic class DebugTest {\n\n  private static int[] testArray \u003d new int[10];\n  private static int someVal \u003d 0;\n  private static Object lockObject \u003d new Object();\n  \n  public static void main(String[] args) {\n  \n  synchronized (lockObject) {\n    someVal \u003d testArray[-1];\t\n  }\n  \t\n  }\n\n}\n\nObviously, an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception is thrown, but the debugger says\nthe error is on line 9, but it\u0027s clearly on line 10. Darin Swanson (who replied\nto my post asking for this bug report) said that the bebugger just reports what\nJVM tells it, but as I\u0027m sure you can see, it is misleading and awkward when the\nerror is actually being thrown by a method as you can\u0027t look into the method to\nsee it\u0027s local variables. I hope something can be done...",
    "The debugger does not produce the stack traces - that is the VM. The same will \nhappen if you do not run under the debugger (try if from the command line).\n\nWhen I run with IBM 1.3.1 or JDK1.4.1, the error is reported on line 10. What \nVM are you using?\n\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1\n\tat DebugTest.main(DebugTest.java:10)\nException in thread \"main\" "
