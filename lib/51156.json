    "Just to confirm: you have enabled automatic updates and don\u0027t want to see \nnetwork errors while running disconnected, right ? If you were actually \nconnected and there were errors, would you expect to see logged errors?\n\nI am marking this as an enhancement, as it is not really a bug.\n",
    "I would disagree that this is not a bug. It\u0027s just not a very serious one, but \nit is clearly a bug and not an enhancement. (Except in the sense that having \nfewer bugs is an enhancement! ;\u003d).\n\nBut regardless:\nIf I am connected, and Comcast or some other router somewhere is out to lunch, \nor the target site has a power outage or something, no, I would not care to \nhave this appear in the log! This is just a normal aspect of the environment.\n\nHere\u0027s what I suggest: Log only successful updates (with no stack trace!). You \ncan see in the log how long it has been since a successful connection. You \nCOULD also warn when the site has been unavailable for an extended time, say a \nweek or so.\n\nRemember, a failed automatic connection is of little import, because it will \nbe retried unti it succeeds anyway.\n\nForeground failures (i.e. by explicit user request from the menu item) should \nbe reported immediately to the user -- but not logged on failure, only on \nsuccess, as only the success has any impact on changing the environment.",
    "I mostly agree with your comments, with one general exception: when somethings \ngoes wrong, product support teams may need to see the error/activity log. \nDeciding what should or should not go in the log is not rocket science, but is \nnot personal preferences either.\n\nFor example: for user triggered update via the ui: if something failed and the \nuser must call the support line, he needs to provide some record of the \nproblem, so a logged network problem would probably be good.\n\n",
    "Making the right logging choice is less critical for infrequent events, and \noften erring on the side of extra information for support helps in the long \nrun. So logging the failuire in the event of a user-initiated update doesn\u0027t \nbother me -- but it only adds value if the customer wouldn\u0027t report the \nfailure reported in the dialog, and if support would make use of the \ninformation.\n\nOne approach is to log information like this to a separate, short-lived log. \nThis can include the last several recent commands and other information which \nyou would not be able to log otherwise but which might help support. \n(Efficiency becomes an issue, but a buffered log with asynchronous formatting, \nand minimal amounts of text is usually acceptable for all except things like \nmouse motion events!)",
    "I like the idea of a log frame that logs the most recent events separately, \nalthough, with some pseudo chaos theory, one could argue the first, oldest \nevent affects is the cause for the most recent one :-)\nAnyway, this is going on a different tangent, so for now, I will leave the bug \nopen and consider investigating the amount of logging during automatically \nscheduled updates.",
    "I don\u0027t believe that automatic updates that fail should prompt the user in\nregard to the failure. If the user initiated the update then by means provide\ninformation on it failing. However, there are plenty of mobile users that will\nhave the machines disconnected from the network when an automatic update occurs.\nIt is certainly fine to leave an error icon in the lower right hand corner\nallowing the user to be notified of the problem without being interuptted.",
    "I\u0027ll add that I have had to turn off automatic updates, since it pops up a \ndialog these days. This is very much a bug, as it renders the feature unusable \nfor a significant population.",
