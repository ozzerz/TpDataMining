    "I\u0027m opening this bug to track effort to make p2 work with a Foundation 1.1 class library. Some random issues encountered:\n\n1) You need to add the following command line arguments when using J9:\n\n-jcl:ppro11 -Dorg.osgi.framework.executionenvironment\u003d\"OSGi/Minimum-1.0,OSGi/Minimum-1.1,CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0,CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1,J2SE-1.2\"\n\n2) Frameworkadmin specifies a 1.4 EE. This may be a case of the EE just not being set correctly.  I changed in the EE in the manifest to Foundation 1.1 and was able to make progress.\n\n3) org.mozilla.rhino requires a 1.4 EE. This also may not be a real problem. I set the EE to Foundation 1.1 on the bundle manifest, and haven\u0027t seen a problem with it yet.\n\n4) Lack of XML parser.  The XML parser from Orbit requires a 1.2 EE. However, the eRCP project has an XML parser that seems to work fine.\n\n  a) Download:\n\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file\u003d/dsdp/ercp/eRCP-v20070801.win32-x86.zip\n\n  b) Extract the two bundles org.eclipse.ercp.xml and org.eclipse.ercp.xmlParserAPIs.\n\n  c) Add the following system property:\n\n-Dosgi.framework.extensions\u003dorg.eclipse.ercp.xml, org.eclipse.ercp.xmlParserAPIs\n\n5) com.thoughtworks.xstream requires java.sql.Timestamp, which is not in Foundation 1.1.\n\nava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java.sql.Timestamp\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.class$(XStream.java:391)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.setupAliases(XStream.java:493)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.\u003cinit\u003e(XStream.java:371)\n        at com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream.\u003cinit\u003e(XStream.java:299)",
    "These issues have been resolved. Framework admin now specifies a Foundation 1.1 EE, and we no longer use Rhino or xstream."
