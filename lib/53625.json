    "This just started with the Eclipse I20040226 driver. When you launch\nself-hosting using PDE, even though it launched correctly, the fact that it is a\nself-hosting launch is lost. When it finally comes up none of the classloaders\nin the bundles are using the bin directory of the supplied plugins from the\ndevelopment workspace. They are pointing instead to the plugins that came out of\nthe target platform.\n\nIf you look at the command line when launched it is correct. It is on the\nlaunched side that seems to be ignoring the -dev bin flag.\n\nThis makes development impossible because you can\u0027t get it to execute your\ndevelopment code.\n\nThanks,\nRich",
    "In the program arguments, check the value of the \"-configuration\" arg.  Then \nnavigate to that directory while your runtime workbench is up, and locate the \nplatform.xml/platform.cfg in it and attach it to this bug report to answer the \nage old question:  where do plug-ins come from?",
    "actually, never mind.\nThe problem is that the 0226 build contains a breaking change in Update where \nthey changed their platform configuration file name from platform.cfg to \nplatform.xml.\n\nPDE has a backward compatibility in the this week\u0027s I-build.  Get 0302 or 0303.",
    "Do I need the 0302 driver for the target platform or for the development platform?\n\nIt is important because I\u0027m not ready to step up to that driver as my\ndevelopment platform. I don\u0027t feel comfortable using it for all of my code. It\nhas a big bug (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d53095 ) that makes\ndebugging very difficult.\n\n",
    "Here is the thing: 0225/0226 are the breaking point.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what your target platform, but I\u0027m talking about what to use for \nthe host platform.\n\nIf your target platform is based on a build that is \u003c 0225, then either use \nthat same build as host platform or use 0303 as host (which you don\u0027t seem to \nwant because of the JDT/Core bug).\n\nIf your target platform is \u003e\u003d 0225, then you should use \u003e\u003d0225 as host \nplatform.  Of course, there is no forward compatibility from pre-0225 builds \nto account for the breaking change in Update.\n",
    "For me using 0226 to host 0226 I get the following error from the launcher.\n\n!SESSION ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Mar 03, 2004 17:28:20.206\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Bundle \nreference:file:C:/dev_eclipse_m7_05/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.osgi.util_3.0.0\n/ [2] is not active\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.ensureBundlesActive\n(EclipseStarter.java:123)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run\n(EclipseStarter.java:93)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke\n(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke\n(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:324)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:279)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:742)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:581)",
    "Jeff, have you seen this one recently?",
    "this usually has to do with a bogus configuration of some sort.  Was this a \nfresh install, not unziped over another one, not manually tweaked, tickled or \nprimped?\n\nMy sense is this must be something in your setup since most of the people here \nhave been using this sort of configuration for the last week with no major \nproblems.",
    "I did a clean install and things work great.  Tks for the help."
