    "This could happen if the service reference for the StartLevel service is null.  This may happen if the framework failed to launch correctly but I would have expected other errors to occur if this was the case.  Are there any other exceptions in your log file?  If a log was created you should see it in your configuration location.",
    "This NPE could happen if during startup it was detected that an installed framework extension was modified or removed.  At this point the framework is shutdown and should be restarted.  The problem is the launch sequence was allowed to continue which could lead to this NPE.  This has been fixed in Bug 182569.  We should also add a null check incase the startlevel service is not available during the installBundles method.",
