    "Eclipse 3.1, WTP 0.7, Oracle 9\n\nI can make a connection, I can browse schemas available to the current user, but\nall schemas are empty. Even the one the user should be able to access (have\nprooved that it should work using DbVisualiser usind the same driver) - just\nschema names, no content - no tables, not synonyms.",
    "I experience the same problem. The following shows up when trying to expand a\nschema node:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat\norg.eclipse.wst.rdb.internal.core.definition.DatabaseDefinitionImpl.supportsSequence(DatabaseDefinitionImpl.java:840)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.wst.rdb.server.internal.ui.explorer.providers.content.layout.vnode.ServerExplorerVNodeContentProviderNav.displaySchemaChildren(ServerExplorerVNodeContentProviderNav.java:105)\n\u003csnip\u003e",
    "I hit the same problem with Oracle 10 but noticed that I could connect to it if \nI set it up an Oracle 8 connection.\n\nSo I played with Oracle_9.xmi a little bit.  Discovered that if I removed \n\n  \u003cpredefinedDataTypeDefinitions xmi:id\u003d\"XML_TYPE_1\" primitiveType\u003d\"XML_TYPE\" \njdbcEnumType\u003d\"509\" orderingSupported\u003d\"false\" groupingSupported\u003d\"false\"\u003e\n    \u003cname\u003eXMLTYPE\u003c/name\u003e\n  \u003c/predefinedDataTypeDefinitions\u003e\n\nthat it all started working again.  I didn\u0027t investigate anymore as I was happy \nenough for the moment (don\u0027t use that type).  \n\nWhen connecting I use (if it matters or helps) the thin driver in the URL, \noracle.jdbc.OracleDriver as the JDBC Driver class and I\u0027m picking it up from \nclasses12.\n\n",
    "Rafal,\n\nI will check into what is causing the exception first. Just want to bring to \nyour attention that the Oracle contribution in WTP is based on SQLModel \n(schema contains sequence) , hence should be supported by design, however, \nsince we don\u0027t have specialized catalog loading to load Oracle sequence (it is \nusing the generic JDBC loader). In any event, it should not cause exception.\n\nAs for your problem on empty schema, what was the catalog you selected? User, \nDAB or ALL?\n\nThanks,\n\nDer ping",
    "I get an exception \"Could not acquire children from extension: class \norg.eclipse.wst.common.navigator.internal.views.extensions.NavigatorContentProvi\nder\" whenever I try to expand any of the schemas.",
    "(In reply to comment #2)\n\nYou can actually leave XML_TYPE in the Oracle 9 and 10 db definitions.  I \nsimply removed the [orderingSupported\u003d\"false\" groupingSupported\u003d\"false\"] text \nfrom both XML_TYPE definitions and things work fine for either version after \nthat.",

    "April,\n\nCould you verify this?\n\n",
    "I have verified with the latest wtp build, the tables are loaded in server \nexplorer. Form the exception stack, the problem was in database definition. \nLooks like it was already fixed. I tried both classes12.jar and classes111.jar.\n\nI will resolve this defect. If it\u0027s still the issue, please let me know.\n\nThanks!\n-April\n",
    "Verified fixed."
