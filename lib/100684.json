    "The StackOverflowError is from JDT and is unrelated to this problem. You should\nopen a separate bug against the Eclipse platform for this. The log is also\nfilled with several other issues that appeared over a couple days of use and are\nunrelated.\n\nThe problem here appears to be that the module id is different from the\ndirectory that the module is being published to, and that the module factory\ndoes not recognize the same id that it initially returned a module with. I have\ntried several different ways, but I am unable to reproduce either behaviour in a\nrecent build.\n\nJ2EE team - Are there any circumstances that a flexible module would have a\n.deployables directory that doesn\u0027t match its name, or an id that doesn\u0027t match\nits name? Things look ok for both, and everything appears to be working when I\ntested - if you\u0027ve made any fixes in this area recently then this bug might have\nalready been fixed.",

    "This bug was moved to \u0027closed\u0027 state, since it is so old is is assumed its dup, invalid, or worksforme resolution is no longer in qustion and the bugzilla needs no further attention. Feel free to re-open, or open a new bug, if this semi-automatic processing was done in error in this case. "
