    "Build 20020521 (freeze 1)\n\nUnfortunately I have no idea what caused this.  I just found the exception stack \ntrace in my log file a couple of hours after the error happened.  I will attach \nthe complete stack, but here\u0027s the top frames:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.actions.SelectionConverter.codeResolve(SelectionConv\nerter.java:144)\n\tat orx`g.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.FindAction.run(FindAction.java:236)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d1075)\nlog file showing stack trace\n",
    "guard the code against null pointer accesss",
    "John could it be that you triggered a search from a Java file loaded from the \nrepository. In this case the editor input isn\u0027t a compilation unit which lets \nthe code resolve fail.",
    "Line 144 contains the code\n\nreturn codeResolve(getInput(editor), (ITextSelection)editor.getSelectionProvider\n().getSelection());\n\nIt seems that the FindAction has called the SelectionConverter with a editor \u003d\u003d \nnull. Guarding against this doesn\u0027t make any sense.\n\nOpened bug 18079 for guard against repository files\n\nMoving to Daniel for comments",
    "There\u0027s a remote possibility, but I don\u0027t recall trying to do this recently.  \nPressing F4 in a remote class does cause a NPE, but not the same as the one in \nthis bug report.  I was certainly opening lots of editors on class files in \nremote JARs, which also aren\u0027t backed by IFile...  Also of possible interest, I \nalways use the \"show selected element only\" mode in the java editor.",
    "Happened because the actions itself were enabled on the remote editor.\nThis is now fixed/covered by 18079.\n\n",
    "pls verify",
    "Verified that search actions are disabled if editor doesn\u0027t work on CU or class \nfile. ",
    "Moving to verified bucket"
