    "With the WTP 2.0 05171455 driver, I got the following exception while doing a top-down Axis2 scenario:\n\nException occurred while code generation for the WSDL null\n    java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:64)\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:615)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.creation.core.command.Axis2WSDL2JavaCommand.execute(Axis2WSDL2JavaCommand.java:168)\n\nI tried it again with the same workspace and a different project and got the same result.\n\nHowever, when I tried a different workspace, I can go through a top-down Axis2 scenario successfully.\n\nI suspect I ran into the problem because I had done other Axis1 scenario and tested with the WSE.  I think what I did in the workspace that failed was a bottom-up Axis1 Web service followed by testing the UDDI page on the WSE.  However, I could not reproduce it again on a new workspace either.  Please take a look at the stack trace of the failed scenario and see if you can spot what might cause this.  I suspect it might have to do with which plugins are loaded first when the Axis2 scenario is run.",
    "Kathy, I could not reproduce this problem in a new workspace and doing bottom-up Axis1 Web service followed by testing the UDDI page on the WSE, and then doing the Axis2 Top Down Scenario. \n\nFrom the stack trace, what I can think of is that the service definition pointing wsdl in the main page of the web service scenatios is not correctly inserted/passed or the pointing wsdl can not be loaded as a Axis2 wsdl definition. Is there any cause by or a .log trace which I can look at?\n\nThanks \n\nLahiru",
    "I\u0027m also getting the following intermittent error when going through an Axis2 client scenario:\n\nException occured while code generation the wsdl\n    java.lang.NoSuchMethodException: org.apache.axis2.description.WSDL11ToAxisServiceBuilder.setCodegen(boolean)\n    at java.lang.Class.throwNoSuchMethodException(Class.java:274)\n    at java.lang.Class.getMethod(Class.java:799)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.utils.WSDL2JavaGenerator.getAxisService(WSDL2JavaGenerator.java:369)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.command.Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.execute(Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.java:89)\n\nI\u0027m still trying to find a consistently reproducible scenario when this would always occur.  I still suspect it has something to do with combination of Axis1 and Axis2 scenarios.  I\u0027ll append more info when I have them.",
    "I\u0027m finally able to consistently reproduce the problem on the WTP 2.0 RC2 200706050057 driver.  Here\u0027s the steps:\n\n1. In a new workspace, install a Tomcat 5.5 server and Axis2 1.2 runtime.\n2. Create 2 dynamic Web project \"a2a\" and \"a2aClient\" adding Axis2 facet.  \n3. Create an Axis2 top-down Web service (service slider set to START).  Click Finish.\n4. Create an Axis2 bottom-up Web service with client (service and client slider set to START).  Click Finish.\n\nHere\u0027s the error:\n\nException occurred while code generation for WSDL null\n    java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:64)\n    at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\n    at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:615)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.utils.WSDL2JavaGenerator.getAxisService(WSDL2JavaGenerator.java:379)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.command.Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.execute(Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.java:89)\n    at org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.core.fragment.CommandFragmentEngine.runCommand(CommandFragmentEngine.java:418) \n\nAfter dismissing the error, I was still able to successfully generate Axis2 service and client by clicking Next all the way.  Afterwards, I could also repeat the bottom-up Axis2 scenario clicking Finish no problem.  So it only seems to happen the first time after skeleton Axis2 scenario.\n\nI\u0027ve also tried bottom-up Axis2 scenario followed by top-down Axis2 scenario.  That was no problem as well.",

    "Hi Kathy , \n\ncould not reproduse as how you explain in this scenarios. I strongly believe in my opinion that the problem here is that I am loading the wsdl definition more than onece. So trying to fix that with the minimum effect on the other codes. If you please try with little bit more memory and see whether this error poersist, that will be also helpful \n\nThanks \n\nLahiru ",
    "The sequence of steps to produce this is something of a corner case, and can be avoided or recovered from quite easily. Please write a limitation. Deferred to 2.0.1.",
    "I\u0027ve run into this problem with the WTP 2.0 06/13 driver still.  Please try to reproduce the problem following the steps in comment #3.  \n\nThere are also times when bottom-up plus client would always have the Axis2 client page coming up blank but then I could not reproduce it consistently yet.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d73428)\nFix for the 187840\n\nException occurred while code generation for the WSDL null\n    java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n\nIn the above UI error message the null part is because of the Invocation target exception not being having the message attach to it. Rather it contains an AxisFault Wrapped in the target. I have fixed this and what happen in these scenatio that are reported as failing the server returns an AxisFault due to various reasons like connection rest, fault message income, etc , \n\nThis fix covers the part of the AxisFault unwrapping and displaying the correct\n user message. \n\nThis is an isolated fix and we can safely include this to WTP 2.0.1\n\nThanks \n\nLahiru",

    "I tried the latest patch with the scenario reported in comment 3.  I do not get that error anymore.  So you can commit this change and I\u0027ll release it to a build.",

So you can commit this change and I\u0027ll release it to a\n\u003e build.\n\nActually the reason behind this is the servlet container needed a split second of time to get the service deployed after the service and client invoked together. So     its always better that we forcefully deploy the service by invoking a fully build   of the Dynamic Web Project.\n\nThanks \nLahiru   \n\n",
