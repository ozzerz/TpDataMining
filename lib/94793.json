    "i200505092010\n\nGot the following NPE:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n  at\norg.eclipse.osgi.framework.adaptor.core.BundleEntry$ZipBundleEntry.getFileURL(BundleEntry.java:154)\n\nHere is the relevant code:\n\npublic URL getFileURL() {\n  try {\n    File file \u003d bundleFile.getFile(zipEntry.getName());\n    return file.toURL(); // \u003c\u003c NPE happens here\n  } catch (MalformedURLException e) {\n    //This can not happen. \n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\t\nBasically, it is not prepared to handle the case where BundleFile#getFile will\nreturn null. That is possible. In my scenario, the file (a JAR file inside a\nJAR\u0027d bundle) could not be extracted because I was running with the\nconfiguration area in read only mode. It is true that that would fail later\nanyway, but the NPE makes the problem hard to diagnose.\n\nThe fix seems simple (make sure all clients of BundleFie#getFile handle null),\nand I believe we should fix it for M7.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d20998)\npossible fix\n\nRafael, please review this patch and let me know if it is ok to release.",
    "Fixed in HEAD."
