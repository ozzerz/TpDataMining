    "Running with the Iteration 2 test pass build from 10-09.\n\nIf I start the \"old\" AC from Iteration 1, my URL tests run to completion.\n\nRunning the Iteration 2 AC, most tests fail to run on BOTH Windows and Linux (new AC) either with local host or as a remote agent.  Occassionally a test will complete.  The consistent behavior on Windows and Linux provides added confirmation of the problem.  URL test execution remains blocked in Iteration 2.\n\nAli and Valentina also reported similar problems with URL tests on the same build.\n\nI get a consistent repeatable failure on my Windows machine when using the IAC where there is a timeout followed by an InactiveProcessException. Nobody else seems to be seeing this problem.\n\nI will add more information as it becomes available.",
    "Which i1 build were you using for what you referred to as \"old\" AC?",
    "Sounds like bug 158872, assigning to Thay, copying Samson.",
    "The folder that the \"old\" ac is in is dated 9/11 while most of the files in the install are dated 9/7.  It was the install I used for the final iteration 1 test pass.  Is there a way to identify the AC build number from the install?\n\nAs added info, I am running IBM JVM 1.5 SR2.\n\nPlease change the priority to P1.  I don\u0027t have the permissions for that change.\n\n\n\n",
    "Can we increase the priority to P1?",

    "The referenced defect is no longer considered a blocker.\n\nI investigated further, it turns out that all the tests I was trying were from chunk encoded server responses, with the problems reported by others helping to convince me it was the AC in addition to running fine against the old \"AC\".\n\nSo, most of the problem is actually mine.  However, the problem with Solaris still looks like a real problem.  To avoid confusion, I will see if we can get independent confirmation of the Solaris problem and file a Solaris only AC defect.\n\nThe problem with not being able to execute against the IAC (InactiveProcessException) seems to be unique to my machine so far, although I would still like to nail down that issue.\n\n As luck would have it, in the process of working on a different defect, I have a fix for this problem that only needs some added testing before checkin.  I would like permission to deliver the fix this afternoon (before I go on vacation), since the fix is only in a single source file and it only affects URL Test execution.\n\n",
    "Changing severity from blocker to critical.  I have a tested fix ready for delivery when I can get permission to checkin.  It is limited to a single source file and only affects URL Test Execution against a server that responds with chunk encoded data.",
    "I am getting the same error dialog on my local Windows machine:  \"IWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine\" when running Junit tests with Solaris as my remote host. This occurs each time when the tests are at 66%. I am also using the i2 test pass build from 10-09.",
    "DuWayne, could you clarify whether your patch mentioned above fixes the Solaris problem. ",
    "No need to clarify, it turns out my problem was specific to the Solaris server we were testing on and has been resolved.",
    "Please target to 4.4 since all non-blocking/critical defects will be deferred as decided in today\u0027s AG call.",
    "Changing to critical.  This is a regression.  Had previously inadvertently changed from blocking to major, should have been set to critical.  Per discussion in today\u0027s TPTP Test Tools Project Weekly Meeting, will be requesting to fix this defect.\n\nThe fix has been tested, is contained in a single source file, and only affects URL test execution against a chunk encoded server response.  I will be entering a test case to cover this problem.",
    "Fixed 10/24/06 in HttpRequestHandler.java.  Will add/modify test cases Wednesday (10/25).  Found and corrected additional problems yesterday and today during testing.  Wanted to get this in today to test with a real build as soon as possible, since it is runner code and affects proper URL testing on all agent configurations. I will mark it as FIXED after adding test cases.",
    "In HttpRequestHandler.java, fixed a problem seen in further URL execution testing that caused errors and could cause a hang due to Integer.parseInt NumberFormatException. Still planning to add test cases today and mark this defect as fixed.",
    "Fixed as noted above, adding test cases today.",
