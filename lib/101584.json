    "In the 20050623-1200 examples build, I cannot open the undo example views (Box \nView and Undo History View.)  I get a Class not found exception (appended \nbelow).\n\nWassim suggested a fix to the build.properties file, but I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s \nworking, as the built jar only has the jar itself inside it.  So something is \nnot right.  Note that it runs fine from a runtime workspace.  I\u0027ll release the \nchanges Wassim suggested to the build, but I need help on this one - there is \nstill a problem...\n\nHere\u0027s the exception.\n\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.ui.examples.undo.views.BoxView\n\tat org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.BundleLoader.findClass\n(BundleLoader.java:403)\n\tat org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.BundleLoader.findClass\n(BundleLoader.java:350)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.osgi.framework.adaptor.core.AbstractClassLoader.loadClass\n(AbstractClassLoader.java:78)\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.BundleLoader.loa",
    "Should this example be built as a jar\u0027d plug-in?",
    "I will need to update the org.eclipse.sdk.examples feature if yes.",
    "yes it should",
    "I have updated and released the feature for the midnight build.",
    "Susan, I exported your plugin with the build.properties as it appears in HEAD \nand it worked great.\n\nPerhaps, you didn\u0027t use the Plug-in export wizard?",
    "I used File\u003eExport\u003eDeployable Plug-ins and Fragments.\nNot sure if that is what you meant.\n",
    "The views appear in I20050624-0010.",
    "the broken plugin was initially flat in your install.\nthe one you exported was a self-contained JAR.\n\nCould it be that you forgot to delete the old one from your install and you \nended up with two and the bad (old) won?\n\nIn any event, it\u0027s all fine so this bug can be closed.",
    "When I tried it last night, I had deleted the old install (plug-in folder) and \nadded the JAR.  At that point, the view didn\u0027t even show up in the Show View \nmenu.  I must\u0027ve exported it wrong, as the JAR did not look like it should.  \n\nFixed now, though.  ",
