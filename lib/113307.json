    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Could not reproduce with latest. Could you please provide the build id?\n\nIt\u0027s the latest 3.2M2 stable build: I20050923-1000\nBy the way: The Eclipse starts screen shows \"3.2\", but the \"About Eclipse SDK\"\ndialog states: \"Version: 3.1.0  Build id: I20050923-1000\"",
    "In 3.2 stream, plugin version IDs have not yet been incremented, thus the 3.1.0\nversion. This will be fixed before 3.2 ships.",
    "To clarify, \"latest\" for Olivier and I mean using the material which is in HEAD.\nThe stable version you tried is about a month old, and since then we released\nnumerous bug fixes.",
    "Tried with latest and it works fine for me.\n\nPlease reopen if the problem still exists for you after taking the latest drop."
