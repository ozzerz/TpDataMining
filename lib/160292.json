    "this problem also occures on linux motif.\nlooks like a general motif problem.",
    "Is this bug reproducible for you? If so, could you provide the steps and/or a snippet, please?",
    "steps to reproduce:\n\n1. open eclipse on solaris with a new workspace\n2. create or import some projects into the workspace\n3. close eclipse\n4. reopen eclipse and select the same workspace you created before\n\n--\u003e you get the NPE",
    "I believe I might have a simalar error.  I\u0027m running FC6 eclipse 3.20.  When I select the Switch workspace command and click on the browse button, It freezes up.

    "Masha - \n\nthis bug is marked critical, is reproducable with step-by-step instructions, according to comment #5 it was reproduced by somebody else as well. It has a one-liner patch attached that looks reasonable. Yet it has not been addressed since half a year.\n\nBecause of this issue, we need to patch each and every Eclipse drop we get before we put it into our product. Do you see any problem with the patch? Or why isn\u0027t this addressed?\n\nIs there any chance for getting this done for 3.3? It would save us a lot of work patching Eclipse.",
    "I didn\u0027t realize that this bug was left with Masha, I\u0027ll take ownership.\n\nI cannot reproduce the problem using the steps in comment 4 on linux-motif with either eclipse 3.2 or eclipse 3.3 I20070427-0010, and comment 5 does not describe the same problem since it is a segfault.\n\nThe underlying issue appears to be that on motif a Paint event can be received before a Resize event has come in.  It would be better to address this problem, but since I cannot reproduce it here this is difficult.\n\nThe patch that\u0027s provided seems safe because it can only affect the specific case of a Paint coming in before the first Resize has since the curve field gets overwritten for each Resize anyways.  I\u0027ll apply the change.",
    "fixed \u003e 0427",
    "Thanks a bunch!\nWe\u0027ll verify with 3.3M7."
