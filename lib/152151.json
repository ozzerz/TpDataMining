    "After speaking with the originator, this defect is found with a consuming product that ships TPTP V4.2.0 GA running the Integrated Agent Controller (IAC) on Windows XP Professional SP2.  However, using TPTP V4.2.0 GA, this defect cannot be reproduced using the Integrated Agent Controller (IAC) or Agent Controller.  \n\nSince the test execution is stalled/stopped at 60% (test suite/dependency deployment to the target machine), I would assume that the problem is with the Integrated/Agent Controller packaged with the consuming problem -or- a write access/disk space issue with the user\u0027s %TEMP% directory.\n\nPlease try using the Agent Controller.  Re-open the defect with a test case using only TPTP for reproducing the problem.",
