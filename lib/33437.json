    "I had the same problem twice since I installed 2.1 (2 days...).\n\nIn \"dialog_settings.xml\" and \"workbench.xml\", after having restarted \nEclipse, \"org.eclipse.team.cvs.*\" classes where renamed using \nthe \"org.eclipse.team.ccvs\" package. Eclipse reloaded correcly, but I was not \nable to use CVS and a fatal error occured everytimes I tried to compile a \nclass.\n\nI renamed the entries correctly using the \"org.eclipse.team.cvs\" package and \neverything is working now.",
    "What version were you running before you upgrade? 1.0? 2.0? another?\n\nDid you have any information in your /workspace/.metadata/.log file? I don\u0027t \nbelieve that malformed entries in the workbench.xml and dialog_settings.xml \nfiles will cause build failures.\n\nWhen you \"renamed the entries\" did you rename the projects in your workspace? \nChange the contents of the above-mentioned XML files?\n\nAdding NE to CC for comment re: workbench/dialog XML files. ",
    "I didn\u0027t upgrade my 2.0.2 installation, I installed it in a new directory.\n\nWhen I look at the log files, I see a lot of stack traces in relation with CVS.\n\nSample stack trace:\n!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-\nin: \"org.eclipse.core.runtime\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSTeamProvider.\u003cclinit\u003e\n(CVSTeamProvider.java:115)\n\n!MESSAGE Error removing nature org.eclipse.team.cvs.core.cvsnature on project \njmap30.\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Resource is out of sync \nwith the file system: /jmap30/.project.\n\nThere are also a couple of stack trace coming from the Visual SourceSafe \nplugin I installed yesterday. It may have a relation between this plugin and \nthe current problem.\nI\u0027m going to uninstall it and see.\n\nI just renamed the entries in both specified files and restarted the \napplication.",
    "Workbench.xml contains just the UI layout.  It\u0027s possible that if packages have \nbeen renamed, then certain views/perspectives/actions will not be found when \nyou restart, and the workbench layout may have to be reset.  \n\ndialog_settings just contains state like the last filter settings on a view.\n\nNeither should affect the build.",
    "Moving to Platform/VCM for comment.\nHave you seen this behaviour before where CVS doesn\u0027t want to play nice with \nothers?",
    "I don\u0027t know what you mean by \"In \"dialog_settings.xml\" and \"workbench.xml\", \nafter having restarted Eclipse, \"org.eclipse.team.cvs.*\" classes where renamed \nusing the \"org.eclipse.team.ccvs\" package.\"? Did you modify these files before \nthe error occured or did the error occur and then you figured out how to fix it \nby modifying these files?\n\nAlso, the log seems to indicate that your .project file is out-of-sync (which \nindicates why you couldn\u0027t make the change to the CVS nature). You can fix this \nby refreshing the project. It is odd, however, that you get this error since \nthe CVS repository provider doesn\u0027t use a nature and hasn\u0027t since pre-2.0. I \nsuspect that this VSS plugin that you mentioned may have copied code from the \nCVS plugin at that time and didn\u0027t properly modify certain properties.\n\nGiven the involvement of the VSS plugin, I\u0027m closing this bug. Please reopen if \nyou experience problems with the CVS plugin when the VSS plugin is not present. \nYou could also check the plugin.xml of the VSS plugin and see if it contains \nthe text \"org.eclipse.team.cvs.core.cvsnature\". If it does, you may want to \ntell the providers of the VSS plugin that they have made a major mistake.\n\nPlease reopen if you can reproduce the problem with the VSS plugin removed."
