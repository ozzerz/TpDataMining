    "Does the same thing occur if you install it somewhere else e.g. a path without a space in it?\n\n",
    "You\u0027ll need to give more details to go on - this works for most people.  Did you unzip on top of a previous version of Eclipse? What did you download - the Eclipse SDK?",

What did you download - the\n\u003e Eclipse SDK?\n\u003e \n\nJohn,\n\nthanks for coming back to me.\n\nYes. I downloaded Eclipse SDK. Also I found previous version of Eclipse (version 3.2) installed. I remember that I installed it about 6 months ago. This installation works fine.\n\nBut I would like to move to a latest version. \n\nDoes it mean that I cannot have two versions on my machine?\n\nThanks.\n\nvlad\n",
    "You can have two versions on your machine, but you cannot unzip a new version directly on top of an old version. You need to unzip the new version into an empty directory. See the file eclipse/readme/readme_eclipse.html for more information on how to upgrade between releases (or readme file on build download page).",
    "Closing. Please re-open if you are able to provide more information to help us track down your problem. Thanks.\n"
