    "When something fails during the early phase of the execution (for instance: the\nlaunched process dies immediately because of a bad classpath, or does not\ninstantiate a control agent), the TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub waits for\nabout one minute and then gives up (the following exception is logged:\norg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\n\tat\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.launch(TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.java:192)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.launchTestExecution(TestExecutionHarness.java:1512)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.access$0(TestExecutionHarness.java:1299)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$1.run(TestExecutionHarness.java:1215)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66))\nBut the job that is monitoring the execution progress never terminates, and it\ncannot be cancelled. I suggest one of the following, in order of preference:\n1) The executor should go a \"dead\" state in such a situation, so that the\nexecution progress job doesn\u0027t wait forever.\n2) The execution job should be cancellable, so the user may get rid of this\nprogress information. The problem here is what to do when the user clicks on\ncancel while the execution is actually being performed? Kill the process, or\njust remove the progress indication?",
    "\nPer suggestion of reporter, the error code now sets the execution component to \nthe DEAD state so the execution progress job picks up the end of the run \ncorrectly.\n\n1) The executor should go a \"dead\" state in such a situation, so that the\nexecution progress job doesn\u0027t wait forever.\n"
