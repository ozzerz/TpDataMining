    "Reported by product team.  Please see if reproducible on 441",
    "I could not reproduce this defect using the 4.4.0.3 driver (Europa fall maintenance release candidate).\n\n\nDuwayne, please look at the code (PeekServerSocket.java:72) to determine if we can handle the closed socket more elegantly.  Also, please provide an estimated sizing.",
    "Not sure, but it looks like there are some potential problems in winding down when using the \"stop recording\" button.  In working on a Vista defect, for example, I noticed that cleanup gets called twice.  The reason is that the RecorderClient.java class calls the appadapter stop method, which in the case of IE, calls Process.destroy().  This results in breaking out of the wait state in the recorder stopper, which in turn call the recorder client stopRecording method which then call stop again (resulting in a second call to cleanup).\n\nThere may also be some funny things that happen due to calling interrupt on the RecorderStopper in addition to destroying the process.  Destroying the process should be adequate by itself, since that will force a breakout from the wait state.\n\nIn any case, it looks like this defect should be addressed by reviewing the logic and simplifying the execution path in a logical manner that is more bullet proof.  Obviously, since there are multiple execution adapters for IE, FireFox, etc., one must be cautious to make sure other browsers do not get broken by fixing IE.\n\nAdding a sizing estimate to include testing various browsers."
