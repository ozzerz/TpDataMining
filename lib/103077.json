    "I\u0027ve downloaded Eclipse 3.1, yet need to develop for 3.0.2 for our RCP app.\nI Set the target platform to an SDK install of 3.0.2, imported external-plugins,\nthose required by my projects.\n\nThis compiles everything.\n\nBut when I go to run the application, eclipse is unable to launch and tells me\nto look at the log. Its contents are:\n\n!SESSION Thu Jul 07 16:28:38 EDT 2005 ------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Jul 07, 2005 16:28:38.750\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.net.MalformedURLException: unknown protocol: c\n    at java.net.URL.\u003cinit\u003e(URL.java:544)\n    at java.net.URL.\u003cinit\u003e(URL.java:434)\n    at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.addDevEntries(Main.java:371)\n    at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.getDevPath(Main.java:284)\n    at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:406)\n    at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:174)\n    at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:704)\n    at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:688)\n\n\n\nI had tried on another machine some time ago, where eclipse was on the d drive,\nand it said \"unknown protocol: d\". Obviously, somewhere its dealing with a\nfilesystem string on my windows machine, and not a url (file:/// ??). Does\nanyone have a solution?\n\nI was able to trace by breaking on the URL calls:\n\n I see that valid URLs look like\n\narg1\u003d\n\"file:C:/31Workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/New_configuration/dev.properties\"\n\n but that the one that messes up ...\n\narg1\u003d \"C:/eclipse-sdk-302/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.osgi_3.0.1/osgi.jar\"\n\n How come it got there? Why does it not have file: ?",
    "I\u0027m sad I haven\u0027t heard from anyone.. but I fell upon this workaround, by chance.\n\nI checked out, from dev.eclipse.org, the 3.1 version plugin \"org.eclipse.platform\".\n\nI didnt change anything else, I just checked it out.\n\nNow my launcher works...\n",
    "To be precise, once it was checked out, I was able to run my rcp app.\n I then realized it picked up org.eclipse.platform 3.1. so I went back to the\nplug-ins tab, unchecked org.eclipse.platform (3.1) from the top half of the\nlist, checked from external plug-ins the org.eclipse.platform (3.0.2) entry, and\nit all works now.",
