    "\nManual tests are now functional in 4.0 -- there were numerous fixes that led \nup to fixing this defect overall:\n\no  Extension point names were changed and the execution harness and other \nrelated code was not yet modified to reflect the name changes\no  JAR names need to be changed to use periods instead of hyphens between name \nfragments; the agent controller pluginconfig.xml files referred to the names \nwith periods (as in 3.3) and this was causing classes not to be found\no  Manual test launch configuration invoke test harness method signature \nchanged to accept progress monitor (was calling into the basic launch delegate \ninstead and the resource was not being set properly on the test implementor \nand therefore the test suite was not called out as needed by the manual test \nrunner\n\nJUnits and URL tests are not verified to function yet in the 4.0 product.",
