    "I can get from CVS the tagged version of R3_1 and it seems \nto work ok, but the version from HEAD does not. \n\nBy \"work\" I mean I tested with a simple test of seeing if antRunner runs. \nSuch as \njava -jar \u003cpath\u003e/startup.jar -application org.eclipse.ant.core.antRunner\n\nWe encountered this with trying to fixup/improve WTP builds. \nPart of the fix for us, as you\u0027d expect, is to use tagged versions of \nbasebuilder ... but ... thought you would want to know. \n\nI\u0027m not sure how you in base do builds? Do you use basebuilder? Or full SDK?",
    "Just tested HEAD and the antRunner seems to work fine.  Could there have been \na problem at checkout time?",

    "I was able to reproduce the problem with the attached script.  \n\nI believe the workaround is to use this command if you want to use contents \nfrom HEAD:\n\ncvs -d :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/eclipse co -r HEAD \norg.eclipse.releng.basebuilder\n\nI ran a diff and the only difference is that the checkout without the \"-r \nHEAD\" checks out a bunch of obsolete empty directories.

[We won\u0027t\nreally do builds from \"head builder\" ... but will ask you to be sure to tag when\ninteresting changes are made and we all should/could update our builder .. we\u0027ll\nbe using R3_1 for several months, at least.]\n\nThanks for checking it out and confirming I wasn\u0027t going crazy :)\n",
    "The problem is as follows:\n- the plugins folder contains:\n   org.eclipse.osgi_3.1.0/ (empty folder)\n   org.eclipse.osgi_3.1.0.jar\n   org.eclipse.osgi_3.0.0/ (empty folder)\n\n- on startup the platform searches the file system and picks highest version of\nthe plugins available. It there are two matches, it just takes the first one\nassuming that all the matches are equivalent and just differ from their\npackaging. It then adds the match to the classpath and run.\n\nIn this particular scenario, it happens that the org.eclipse.osgi_3.1.0 is\npicked but it is empty therefore the startup fails.\n\nThere is nothing we can do about it, from the platform point of view this is an\ninvalid setup.",
