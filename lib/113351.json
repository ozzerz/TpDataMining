    "Ok, with the path given in Michaels comment I took a look at our servers and\nindeed on one of them the /tmp directory was full due to a tomcat crash, which\nwould explain the error. I have restarted that server( which was the cause of\nDougs hangup ) and cleaned out the /tmp directory. So things should be back to\nsomething resembling normal now.\n\nI have to ask a really stupid question: is the cvs repository you are using set\nto dev.eclipse.org?
