I have also installed the YourKit profiler into this build. While trying to launch a profiling session I get an error dialog saying \"An error occurred while attempting to resolve the data collectors selected.\" Since I can\u0027t click on the details to get further info, I go to the Error log where I find the following stack trace:\n\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: An error occurred while attempting to resolve the data collectors selected\n    at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.internal.launcher.core.LauncherUtility.createCoreException(LauncherUtility.java:112)\n    at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.internal.launcher.core.LauncherUtility.createCoreException(LauncherUtility.java:120)\n    at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.provisional.launcher.PrimaryLaunchDelegate.run(PrimaryLaunchDelegate.java:152)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d40493)\nError dialog for attempted profiler launch\n\n",
