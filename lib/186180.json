    "When running Axis2 Web service (with Axis2 1.2) on servers that already has Axis2 JARs, I got the following error in the server console:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.axiom.om.impl.llom.OMTextImpl incompatible with org.apache.axiom.om.impl.OMNodeEx\n\tat org.apache.axis2.transport.http.AxisServlet.initConfigContext(AxisServlet.java:492)\n\tat org.apache.axis2.transport.http.AxisServlet.init(AxisServlet.java:406)\n\nThis is likely because the server has older Axis2 JARs.",
    "Each Axis2 version depends on axiom version. so in the 1.2 case this is the result. \n\n/axis2-1.2/lib$ find -name \u0027*.jar\u0027 -exec grep OMNodeEx {} \\; -print\nBinary file ./axiom-api-1.2.4.jar matches\n\n/axis2-1.2/lib$ find -name \u0027*.jar\u0027 -exec grep OMTextImpl  {} \\; -print\nBinary file ./axiom-impl-1.2.4.jar matches\n\nIf the early class path would point to an early release, we are out of options and simply running to trouble. \n\nBut since we did the WTP Axis2 Plugins through reflection, I do not understand how another framework would come to the picture other than the system class path and the jre class path. Certainly WTP is not doing this..\n\nThoughts / Comments ?\n\n\nThanks \n\nLahiru \n\n\n\n",
    "I\u0027ll pursue this problem a bit more with the server group first.  Even though the server runtime is using a different version of Axis2 JARs, they should not interfere with other versions of Axis2 JARs the user choose to put on the container classpath.",
    "Thanks Kathy, Please get back to me with the server groups feedback on this issue. \n\nLahiru",
    "The problem occurs since the Axis2 JARs are on certain server\u0027s classpath and the classloader behaviour for the server is set to \"PARENT_FIRST\".  These Axis2 JARs are conflicting with the Axis2 JARs in the Web project.  To avoid this problem, the user would have to go into the application configuration for the EAR/WAR to change it from \"PARENT_FIRST\" to \"PARENT_LAST\" and restart the EAR/WAR.",
