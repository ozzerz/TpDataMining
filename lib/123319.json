    "Is there any workaround for this, or patch available?  Also this is against 3.2 right?  The problem does not exist in version 3.1.1 does it?",
    "Actually my build number is wrong - it is in 20060110 only and is not in any other build. 3.2 M4 or 3.1.1 should not have this issue.",
    "*** Bug 123799 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "This makes it impossible to work with I20060110 or greater for more than 30 minutes.",
    "This is fixed in the nightly builds (which didn\u0027t run) as of 20050113 but I didn\u0027t close the bug yet as I was hoping to run with them",
    "Fixed in 20060119",
    "Verified in 20060213-1200"
