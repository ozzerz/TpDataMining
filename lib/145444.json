    "I have seen this problem occur on EM64T when you group all of the test cases together.  However, if you run these test cases individually, rather than as a group the majority of them pass.  Navid may shed some more light on this issue later.  \n\nI was able to reproduce the error in the \u0027StandaloneMode\u0027 test case, becuase the location of my Agent Controller was not in my PATH variable.  Once I added the Agent Controller in the PATH variable the test case passed.\n\nThe HeapJniCarTest does not have proper expected results.  Since we are comparing results of a 32-bit Windows_XP machine with 64-bit Windows_IPF/EM64T the expected results do not match.  I was able to manually verify that hprof and piAgent are providing the same object size.  Therefore we need to update this specific test cases to contain the correct expected results. \n\nRegarding the \u0027ArgumhentsTest\u0027, Kevin mentioned that there is a buggzilla opened for this, maybe he can shed some light on this issue.\n\nI will attach the test execution results from my testing on EM64T below.  ",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d43616)\nOutput from the Automation Framework\n\nI have attached the file containing the output from the Automation framework. The only scenario I still need to look at is FilterTest01, otherwise the rest of the test cases either passed, or there is an explanation as to why they failed.",
    "The problem you\u0027re seeing above could be caused by either one of the following:\n\n1) The Agent Controller or piAgent might not be cleaning up after themselves properly.  This also includes the data structures that have to be updated on the client side (i.e. the execution framework).\n\n2) I\u0027ve noticed that the Agent Controller isn\u0027t able to handle agent operations when they\u0027re executed too quickly.  For example, when I attach to an agent I have to give it a few seconds before detaching from it.  If this is done too quickly, it won\u0027t work.  What determines the delay time between agent operations and user input is the \u0027delay_time\u0027 attribute of \u0027execution_info\u0027 element.  Please consider setting the delay time higher to see if it makes a difference.  Note that you might also have to increase the time out value of the testcase in order for the testcase to have enough time to execute. This can be done by adjusting the \u0027time_out\u0027 attribute of \u0027execution_info\u0027.  The value of both \u0027delay_time\u0027 and \u0027time_out\u0027 is represented in milliseconds.\n\nBTW, the bugzilla for ArgumentsTest is bug#131786",
    "The problem with unexpected object sizes in the HeapJniCarTest is a dup of bug 135148, part b (as described in comment #3). The fact that object sizes can vary across vendors and releases of jdks is described there and some example differences are included there.",
    "Me and Victor just updated the Heap* testcases.  These testcases now do a robust check of what JDK is being used and compare the results accordingly. Run the updated testcases to see whether they pass.\n\nNote that these testcases could still fail, since you\u0027re running on a 64bit platform.  I don\u0027t think Heap* testcases are just JDK dependent, they could also be OS dependent.  I get a completely different result when running these on AS400.  Thus the problem might not exactly be what\u0027s described in bug#135148.  ",
    "I tested the new Heap* testcases but they do not work because the expected results are different from the actual results.  Once I have some time later, I will update the test cases with the correct expected results.",
    "Looks like the problem can be reduced to known bugzillas bug#131786 and  bug\n135148 and test case problem.\n\nResolving to \"invalid\" because of \"worksforme\" and \"dup\""
