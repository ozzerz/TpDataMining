    "i want to set Page Break Interval in 21RC4,but it cannot be found.\nhow can set Page Break Interval in 21RC4, thanks!",
    "It is not supported now.\nWhat\u0027s you case to need this?\nI think you can use page break + scripting to support same feature.",
    "could u explain the solution in details?thanks!\n\u003e It is not supported now.\n\u003e What\u0027s you case to need this?\n\u003e I think you can use page break + scripting to support same feature.\n\n",
    "Try to count the no of table in scripting. When the count reach the no, set a hard page break.",
    "i\u0027m confused that why to remove Page Break Interval in 21?\nactually,i think it is very practicably in projects.\nit is complicated procedue using PAGE BREAK + SCRIPTING. i dont think it is fine way.\n\nanother question, when preview a simple table in designer,the result page always show the first data row of the whole resultset of dataset which previewed in dataset view correctly.\nwhy?\nthanks!\n\u003e Try to count the no of table in scripting. When the count reach the no, set a\n\u003e hard page break.\n\n",
    "thanks for you comments.\nLet\u0027s keep this bug to see if the page break interval can be added back.\nFor question 2, do you use grid or table?\nI don\u0027t think the table will show the first data.\nDo you bind data set to table or bind data set to a data item in table?\n",
    "oops~~~more \u0026 more questions!\n1.trace on the first question,using Total.runningCount() which seemly appears\nin birt 21 to get the row no will be shown in a col named row_id, group on this\nrow_id col to set Range to the number of rows in each group.then got the page\nbreak.\nis right?\nnow i want remove the group index (row id) without removing the page break.\nin fact,i want got a table with page break and repeat header.of course,setting\nof Page Break Interval is better.\n2.for the second question,i rechecked my setting on binding data set,i think it\nis correct.i will check it with other environment.\nthe above questions is based on 21rc5\n3.in birt 201,i found repeat header of table property cannot take effect on\ntable with multi-page. have u fixed it?",
    "1. Yes, using group is on of the way to get the same result. Or you can add scripting on the onCreate method of row and count the row no. If the row now reach the count you want to break, set row.style.pagebreak \u003d true. \n2. For question 2, could you attache the design file then?\n3. For question 3, the answer is yes.",
