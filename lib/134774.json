    "The thing that\u0027s unique about our update site is that it refers to the Tigris.org update site (WTP is starting to do this now too).  I was seeing a similar stack trace when the referenced site was misconfigured or inaccessible.  Could you try the following:\n\n1) Make sure that all versions of Mylar are uninstalled via the Manage Configuration dialog\n\n2) Try to install Mylar without the JIRA support, post if that works\n\n3) If that doesn\u0027t work, as a sanity check try to install into a fresh Eclipse using the default location ",
    "Started with 2) (no Jira support) and it worked!",
    "Great.  Now we know that the trouble comes from trying to install the JIRA dependency.  Whether or not you actually need that, could you point your browser at the URL below and let me know if you can download the JAR?  I\u0027m wondering if this is due to network restrictions on your end or sometihng else:\n\nhttp://jira-dashboard.tigris.org/update/features/org.tigris.jira.core_0.8.0.jar",
    "By coincidence, I\u0027ve tried installing Mylar from three different locations (three different ISPs). Same problem no matter where I was. I have no problem downloading the JAR file using my browser.",
    "Were you trying to install into an Eclipse with that alternate location?  Does installing into the standard location of a clean Eclipse work for you?  \n\nI\u0027m still trying to figure out what the problem is since we haven\u0027t had anyone else report failures to install of this sort and thousands of people have done so.",
    "Mik, sorry for the delay in getting back to you.\n\nI installed to the external Install Location that I tried with originally. So, the only difference is that I did not include Jira support.\n\nAs for installing to the standard location I never had the time try it.\n\nHowever, I tried to the full install of 0.5.0 with same problem as report before. When I deselected JIRA support the Mylar 0.5.0 worked just like with 0.4.10.\n\nLet me know if you want me to try something else for 0.5.x.",
    "I was able to reproduce this once using 3.1.  But installing without JIRA, and then running the update again to get just JIRA worked.  Could you try that?  I\u0027d like to update the top of: http://www.eclipse.org/mylar/doc/faq.php#install to ensure it has the right trouble shooting info.  Thanks.",
    "Any news regarding comment#7, or is the install working for you now?",
    "Jimisola, please reopen if you see this again."
