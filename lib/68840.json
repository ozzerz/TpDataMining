    "Hi\nProblem is I can\u0027t track errors when I run programs using Ant script. \n\nThere is en exaple:\nJava source \nMain.java:\npackage pl.kapital.bug;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(args[1]);\n\t\t} catch (RuntimeException e) {\n\t\t\tSystem.err.println(\"ERROR:\");\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace(System.err);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nAnt script\nbuild.xml:\n\u003cproject basedir\u003d\".\" default\u003d\"exec\" name\u003d\"application\"\u003e\n\t\u003ctarget name\u003d\"exec\" description\u003d\"Execute Main Class\"\u003e\n\t\t\u003cjava classname\u003d\"pl.kapital.bug.Main\" fork\u003d\"true\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003cclasspath path\u003d\".\"\u003e\u003c/classpath\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/java\u003e\n\t\u003c/target\u003e\n\u003c/project\u003e\n\nConsole output:\nBuildfile: w:\\eclipse_BUG\\BUG_REPORT\\build.xml\nexec:\n     [java] ERROR:\n     [java] java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 1\n     [java] at pl.kapital.bug.Main.main(Main.java:19)\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nTotal time: 1 second\n\nWhen I click on line\n     [java] at pl.kapital.bug.Main.main(Main.java:19)\nI see information window: \"Source not found for pl.kapital.bug.Main\"\n\nIt works fine for 3.0M8\nSince 3.0M9 hyperliks are broken.",
    "Move to Platform/Ant.",
    "I have verified that this is a problem if you run the Ant build in a separate \nVM. \n\nIf you run the build in the same JRE as Eclipse the source lookup works as \nexpected. \nTo set a build to run in the same JRE as Eclipse, configure on the JRE tab of \nthe Ant launch configuration.",
    "This problem was introduced with the fix for bug 48127.\n\nWith the improvements in source lookup for 3.0 the fix for bug 48127 is no \nlonger needed.\n\nHowever with an incomplete classpath the source lookup fails...I would expect \nthat it should do as well as it can with the incomplete classpath but I am out \nof touch on the specifics of source lookup.",
    "I have released the change to AntLaunchDelegate so that source lookup works in \nthe general case.\n\nWould it be possible or desirable for the StandardSourcePathProvider to do as \nwell as it can when resolving the classpath instead of failing with a \nCoreException on the first problem?",
    "DarinW, please verify (as well with the test case from bug 48127).",
    "verified,\nDarinS please update build notes.",
    "Thanks. Build notes updated.",
    "Note: the source path provider will fail on a core exception. It does not have \nthe required info to decide whether the exception is fatal or not - its API is \njust to throw the exception up. This is a general problem with \nclasspath/source path computation.",
    "We have been experiencing this problem ourselves for a while and testing with a\nrecently nightly build (N20040720) the problem remains.\n\nWill one eventually be able to run ant builds in a separate JRE or is the\nofficially stance not to do so if one wants source code stack trace hyperlinks?",
    "If the problem persists, please re-open with steps to reproduce.",
