    "When trying to run the BottomUp Web Service tutorial from :\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/webtools/jst/components/ws/tutorials/BottomUpWebService.h\ntml\n\nI get the following error:\n\nIWAB0489E Error when deploying Web service to Axis runtime\n  axis-admin failed with\n{http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/}Server.userException\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\nThe error shows up in step 12 after clicking the Finish button it \nchurns for a while then gives me the error:\n\nI also notice that the ERR LOG window shows the message\n (does this represent a problem ?):\n\nSkipping builder com.ibm.etools.j2ee.LibCopyBuilder for project converter.\nEither the builder is missing from the install, or it belongs to a project\nnature that is missing or disabled.\nAn exception stack trace could not be found.\n\nI am running with:\n  Tomcat v5.0 (instead of version 4.1 mentioned in the tutorial)\n  eclipse-SDK-3.1M5a-win32.zip\n  emf-sdo-xsd-SDK-I200502171619.zip\n  GEF-SDK-I20050215.zip\n  JEM-runtime-1.0.2.zip\n  wtp-1.0M3.zip\n\nI modified the log4j.properties file (changed version shown below) to try and\nget additional debug information.\n\nWith these changes it generated an axis.log file which\ncontained the following stack excerpt for the NullPointerException:\n\nAxisFault\n faultCode: {http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/}Server.userException\n faultSubcode:\n faultString: java.lang.NullPointerException\n faultActor:\n faultNode:\n faultDetail:\n {http://xml.apache.org/axis/}stackTrace: java.lang.NullPointerException\n at java.util.Hashtable.put(Hashtable.java:396)\n at com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.SAXParserImpl.setProperty(SAXParserI\nmpl.java:395)\n at org.apache.axis.encoding.DeserializationContextImpl.parse(DeserializationCon\ntextImpl.java:246)\n at org.apache.axis.SOAPPart.getAsSOAPEnvelope(SOAPPart.java:538)\n at org.apache.axis.Message.getSOAPEnvelope(Message.java:376)\n at org.apache.axis.transport.http.HTTPSender.readFromSocket(HTTPSender.java:675\n)\n at org.apache.axis.transport.http.HTTPSender.invoke(HTTPSender.java:128)\n at org.apache.axis.strategies.InvocationStrategy.visit(InvocationStrategy.java:\n71)\n at org.apache.axis.SimpleChain.doVisiting(SimpleChain.java:150)\n at org.apache.axis.SimpleChain.invoke(SimpleChain.java:120)\n at org.apache.axis.client.AxisClient.invoke(AxisClient.java:180)\n at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invokeEngine(Call.java:2564)\n at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:2553)\n at org.apache.axis.client.Call.invoke(Call.java:1672)\n at org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient.process(AdminClient.java:355)\n at org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient.process(AdminClient.java:334)\n at org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient.process(AdminClient.java:341)\n at org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient.process(AdminClient.java:292)\n at org.apache.axis.tools.ant.axis.AdminClientTask.execute(AdminClientTask.java:\n308)\n at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis.consumption.core.command.AxisDeployCommand.\nexecuteAntTask(AxisDeployCommand.java:102)\n at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis.consumption.core.command.AxisDeployCommand.\nexecute(AxisDeployCommand.java:72)\n\n\nThere was lots more in the log file.

    "I\u0027m getting the same error. From the stack trace it appears that axis is using\nthe internal Xerces impl, I wonder if that has anythin to do with it.",

    "What JDK are you using?  From the stack trace, this problem look almost \nidentical to the problem we found when using JDK 1.5 to create bottom-up Web \nservice using Axis 1.1.  You can take a look at defect 92603:\n\nhttps://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d92603",
    "When I was trying to use this tutorial I had both JDK1.4 and JDK1.5 downloaded \nto my system.  I think I had originally seen the error with JDK1.5 active but \ntried to back up to JDK1.4.2_07 to see if I could run with that but got the \nsame error.\n\nI have since found that my attempt to back up missed removing a copy of the \nJDK1.5 java compiler which somehow found its way to C:\\WINNT\\system32.  I have \nsince removed this file.\n\nNow when I try the tutorial with JDK1.5 I get the Null Pointer Exception.  When \nI try the tutorial with JDK1.4.2_07 I get the message \"IWAB0514E Unable to get \nURL for project {0}\" in step 12 after clicking on the finish button.  This \nmessage seems to come out almost immediately (I do not see it trying to build \nanything) so I do not think that I am getting as far as when running with \nJDK1.5.\n\nI am willing to try again but I do not know what to set up so it can find the \nURL.",
    "Since the original problem is caused by Axis 1.1 not able to support JDK 1.5, \nI\u0027m marking this defect as a duplicate of 92603 (that\u0027s the defect we are \ntracking to as an enhancement and pointed to by the News and Noteworthy \ndocument).\n\nWe have seen intermitten problem with \"Unable to get project URL\".  It seems \nlike server tooling was not able to give us the project URL in some cases but \nwe were not able to reproduce the problem consistently in order to have this \ninvestigated.  Are you able to gett this error consistently with the M4 \ndriver?  If so, please open a seperate defect with the your configuration \ninformation (JDK, Tomcat, project setup etc.) and exact steps on how to re-\ncreate the problem.  Thanks!\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 92603 ***",

    "I got this problem (NPE on Axis deployment) with M5 and all possible\ncombinations of tomcat 4.1, 5.0, 5.5 with java 1.5, java 1.4\n\nSo the assumption at comment 8 that Java 1.5 is to blame seems not to be correct",
    "(In reply to comment #10)\n\u003e I got this problem (NPE on Axis deployment) with M5 and all possible\n\u003e combinations of tomcat 4.1, 5.0, 5.5 with java 1.5, java 1.4\n\u003e \n\u003e So the assumption at comment 8 that Java 1.5 is to blame seems not to be correct\n\nI got this bug as well with Eclipse 3.1, WTP1 RC1 and all the newest releases of\nGEF, EMF and JEM\n\nMarc\n\n",
    "I was able to run the Creating Bottom-up Web services tutorial using 0628i WTP \nbuild on eclipse RC4 with jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28 and j2sdk1.4.2_07.  I haven\u0027t \ntested it since then.\n\n- Joan.\n",
    "We had been successful running the bottom-up Web service tutorial using JDK \n1.4.2 with Tomcat 4.0, 4.1 and 5.0 using the various WTP drivers.\n\nI just tried JDK 1.4.2_06 with Tomcat 5.0.28 on Windows 2000 using Eclipse 3.1 \nwith WTP RC1 and the was able to run the scenario successfully.  \n\nLike I said earlier, the only time we get problem with deploying to Axis in \nbottom-up Web service tutorial is with JDK 1.5.  If you need to use JDK 1.5, \nyou will need to wait for defect 98340 (support Axis 1.2 instead of Axis 1.1).  \nIf you need to use JDK 1.5 because you want to run on Tomcat 5.5 , another \noptoin is to run with the compatibility JARs for Tomcat 5.5.  Then you can stay \nwith JDK 1.4.2.\n\nIf you still have problem, please re-open the defect (or open another bug if \nyou are cannot reopen because you are not the originator) with exact steps to \nreproduce the problem including the exact configuration you are using.  We will \ntake a look at that to see why it is causing you problem.",
    "As we are trying to close down WTP 1.5, please get the latest WTP 1.5 driver to verify the bug and reopen if the problem had not been fixed.  If this defect is not verified/reopened by end of day 06/16, I\u0027ll attempt to verify the defect by reproducing the problem as described in the defect.  However, since you know your scenario best, it would be more appropriate if you verify the fix.",
    "I guess you can close this problem because in the roughly 12 months since the problem was reported, the BottomUpWebService tutorial has disappeared from the web and my workspaces and projects that had been used to create the problem seem to have disappeared with it.  I am not yet a user of WTP 1.5 but will be some day so we will just have to hope it is corrected there.\n\nIn general I am more than happy to help verify fixes but it is very rare that a year after reporting a problem I will still have the necessary environment to reproduce the problem.",
    "Closing defect ...\n\nFYI.  The Web services tutorial for WTP 1.0 is at:\n\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/webtools/community/communityresources.html#ws\n\nFollow the link in those tutorials to the tutorials for using the Web services wizard with WTP 1.5.\n"
