    "When starting eclipse, I get a dialog saying \"Problems during startup. Check the\n.log file in the .metadata directory of your workspace\".\n\nThis is in the logfile:\n!SESSION ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Dec 25, 2003 18:51:31.760\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to acquire application service\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:84)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at\nsun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\n        at\nsun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:324)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:279)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:742)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:581)\n\n\nI\u0027m running this command from within the eclipse directory:\n/usr/local/devtools/eclipse/eclipse -data /home/marcus/eclipsews -vm \\\n/opt/sun-j2sdk-1.4.1/bin/javax\n\nI\u0027ve also tried adding\n/usr/local/devtools/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk_3.0.0/os/linux/x86 to\nthe LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

    "Eclipse is not supported under Gentoo Linux but I\u0027ll move this bug to Equinox\nfor comment in case the problem is general and not platform specific. (seems\nsimilar to bug 49379)",
    "Hi,\n\nI\u0027m very surprise by this bug because I\u0027m using gentoo both at home and at work\nwith Eclipse 3.0 M6 GTK and it work fine!\n\nMy system:\n   - 2.4.20-gentoo-r8\n   - gnome 2.4.0\n   - eclipse-SDK-3.0M6-linux-gtk.zip\n   - sun-jdk 1.4.2_02-b03\n\nREM: I havn\u0027t installed eclipse using an ebuild (just unzip under /opt/)",
    "This is probably not specific to \"gentoo\" (whatever that is).  I get the same \nthink on Windows XP (Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]) when trying to \nlaunch 3.0 M6.  Unless that\u0027s just a coincidence...",
    "A number of changes went in for things which may be related to this.  Can you \nconfirm if it is fixed for you in I0121 ?  ",
    "I obtained the similar log trace while running Eclipse 3.0M6 as follows:\n  eclipse -data f:\\eclipse-ws3\n\nThe f: drive is mapped to files and folders running Windows Offline Files and \nFile Folders.  When I switched to local file folder, the problem did not occur.\n  eclipse -data c:\\eclipse-ws3\n\nThis same problem does not occur in Eclipse 2.1.2 (i.e., using f:\\eclipse-ws2).\n",
    "Beware here of issues related to java.nio.  I recall hearing that there were \nsome issues with nio on certain configurations.  May not be related but thought \nI would put it in the pot and see what happens.",
    "There have been many changes which might affect this scenario.  Is anyone still \nseeing this problem?  If not we will close at M8\n",
    "No further problems reported.  Closing"
