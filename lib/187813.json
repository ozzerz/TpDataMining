    "Repeatable on both Windows and Linux, when the workbench is running the 1.4.2 JRE and using the IAC, there is a connect exception (works fine if the AC is running the same JRE or running IAC with 1.5 JRE).  The problem occurs when attempting to perform an HTTP recording or a test execution.  Not clear to me why this would only be when using the IAC or why just the 1.4.2 JRE, but the exception is in the execution harness, so I put the problem in that bucket.\n\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.DaemonConnectException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl._connect(NodeImpl.java:225)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:359)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:347)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$4.run(TestExecutionHarness.java:2433)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:803)\nCaused by: org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.ProcessImpl.getProcessId(ProcessImpl.java:487)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl._connect(NodeImpl.java:220)\n\t... 4 more\n\nHere is line 487 in TestExecutionHarness.java:\n\n\t\t\t\tthis.mapAdapterClasses(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"org.eclipse.hyades.test.core.ExecutionEnvironmentAdapter\", \"EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_ADAPTER\", bStandalone); //$NON-NLS-1$ //$NON-NLS-2$",
    "I have passing results for JUnit with IBM 1.4.2 and Sun 1.4.2 for both IAC and AC.  I initially ran into problems if I first ran the workbench with 1.5, because the Java compiler compliance settings were emitting Java 5 classfiles, which caused this type of error.  I also found that classes weren\u0027t rebuilt as they should have been when I switched JREs in the workbench.\n\nI will take a look.",
    "Joe is investigating.",
    "I am unable to reproduce this.  I am switching back \u0026 forth between 1.4.2 IAC and 1.4.2 AC and am unable to break anything -- it works fine.\n\nI expect there is something dirty remaining in your configuration somewhere from when you used a 1.5.  I will investigate on DuWayne\u0027s machine to figure out what the issue is, but I am reducing severity to major, since I believe this problem is caused by switching from 1.5 to 1.4.2, and this is not a major use case.",
    "(In reply to comment #3)\n\nThanks Joe.  Deferring to 4.4 since all JUnit and manual test execution test suites passed.\n",
    "This appears to be caused by the use of the All-in-one driver, which includes only EMF 2.3, and not 2.2.  2.3 requires Java 1.5, so we should expect problems using the all-in-one with JRE 1.4.2.\n\nIt\u0027s still surprising how far DuWayne got with 1.4.2 and EMF 2.3 -- I am puzzled that he was able to create tests at all in the workbench.  He is investigating a bit further by adding EMF 2.2 to his install.",
    "This appears to be the result of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d186230.",
    "EMF 2.3 and JRE 1.4.2 do not play well together.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 186230 ***\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 186230 ***",
