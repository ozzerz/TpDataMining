    "Had you completed an export before this happened?  If so, from \nthe .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.ui directory, can you attach the file \ndialog_settings.xml?  Perhaps it has something to do with the last selected \ndirectory.\n\nIs there anything special about your workspace (location not on local drive \nmaybe or something else) or any of the projects in your workspace (located in \nanother workspace, not in default location, something else)?",

    "I haven\u0027t used File System export recently, so one unusual fact about my\nworkspace is that I moved it over from a Windows machine to a Mac.  I thought of\nthat, though, and deleted the history items from the dialog_settings.xml file\nwhen I was trying to figure out why I couldn\u0027t do a file export.\n\nAt the time of the bug report, there was nothing else unusual about the\nworkspace (although since then I have created a workaround for not having file\nexport by creating a project whose location is on the afs server that I was\ntrying to export to, so I can just do a copy between projects).\n",
    "I looked at this problem on the Mac for a while and it will likely require some more investigation.  But I \nhave a few more questions.  \n\nDid the problem happen the first time you tried to Export to File System after you moved the workspace \nfrom Windows to Mac, or had you been able to successfully do a few exports before the problem \nstarted happening?  \n\nDoes the problem still happen if you remove the FileSystemExportWizard section from \ndialog_settings.xml?  I wonder if the /afs/... item in your history is what\u0027s causing the problem.  \n\nRIght now the only possibilities I can see, based on the stack trace, for the cause of the NPE is the \nlocation of one of the projects is null, or the workspace root location is coming back as null.  Both very \nodd things to occur, but I don\u0027t think consistency is guarantted when switching platforms and using the \nsame workspace in 3.1.  ",
