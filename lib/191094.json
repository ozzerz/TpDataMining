    "In my workspace, I\u0027m editing all the Manifest.mf files, adding version specifiers at the \"Require-Bundle\" statements, i.e. adding this:\n   ;bundle-version\u003d\"[2.0.0,3.0.0)\"\n\nAfter it worked OK for about 20 Manifest\u0027s, I got this logged:\n\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 3\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.builders.BundleErrorReporter.validateRequireBundle(BundleErrorReporter.java:503)\n\tat \n\nSee also attached .log",

    "I\u0027m running Eclipse-3.3RC3 on WinXP SP1 / Sun 1.6.0_01\nThe Manifest\u0027s look OK to me.\n",
    "Is this reproduceable?  If so, is there any way you might be able to provide a test project which shows this problem?  ",
    "It\u0027s not reproducable. From 50 files modified, it happened only once.\nI\u0027m sorry but I don\u0027t have much time helping you get this reproducable...\nI had hoped the log would help finding potential issues through code review.\n",
    "The log does provide us with some good information.  PDE parses the Require-Bundle header text to find the required bundles and also queries the resolver state to find BundleSpecification which represent the required bundles.  We use both to validate the Manifest correctly.\n\nIf the resolver is being kept up to date with all Manifest changes, these #\u0027s will be the same.  So some how these got out of sync which is leading to the Exception.\n\nSince this is not easily reproducable and doesn\u0027t appear to have a clear-cut cause, we can investigate this more post 3.3."
