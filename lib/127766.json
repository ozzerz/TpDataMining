    "3.2M4\n\nIt seems to be disallowed to create explicit, named subclasses of Enum.\nBut anonymous subclasses are not disallowed. Not sure if this is a bug in the compiler or hole in the spec or just a bizzare feature of the language.\n\n//no error here\nEnum e\u003d new Enum(\"foo\", 2){\n public int compareTo(Object o) {\n  return 0;\n  }            \n}\n\nclass B extends Enum{ } //error here",
