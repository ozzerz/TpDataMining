    "Hi,\n\nWe have created an application as the eclipse plugin. And created the seperated installer, which includes required eclipse plugin jar files.\nBut on starting my application, I am getting the following poup message:\n\n      Application command execution \"{EXE_file}\"  failed ! Exitcode\n\nAlso find the errorlog details below:\n\n!SESSION 2006-09-05 19:23:17.547 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dM200409161125\njava.version\u003d1.5.0\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nCommand-line arguments:  -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -data {MyProject_Destination_folder}\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2006-09-05 19:23:17.953\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to acquire application service.\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:367)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:163)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.invokeFramework(Main.java:334)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:278)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:973)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:948)\n\n\nThanks and Regards,\nBraj Kishore",
    "Could you provide a command line you use to launch Eclipse (or eclipse.ini if you use it) and the description of the application extension point from the plugin.xml?\n",
    "Hi,\n\nThanks for your reply.\nPlease find the steps, I am using to execute our application:\nStep 1: Build the application.\nStep 2: Create the exe file, for the plugin application. This application contains only depdendent eclipse 3.1.2 plugin and features jar files.\nStep 3: Install the application. This does not contain eclipse.ini, only startup.jar at the parent folder.\nStep 4: Start the application. This is creating the problem, which I mentioned you earlier. I even checked the plugin.xml file, we are creating at our side.\n\nNOTE: Using the same steps on Eclipse 3.0 and using eclipse 3.0 plugin and feature jar file is working fine. Also, testing from inside the eclipse 3.1.2 environment is working fine. To create the executable application, I added all those jar files, which are avilable in Eclipse 3.1 runtime environment to run our application.\n\nThanks and Regards,\nBraj Kishore\n\nThanks and Regards,\nBraj Kishore",
    "OK, now I am confused :-). Your application: is it an RCP application or is it a standalone Java application? \n\nIf it is an RCP application, you need to: 1) define an application extension  in the plugin.xml, and 2) specify somehow (in the config.ini, or in the command line, or some other way) the application to be launched. That\u0027s why I asked to see how you launch it and the contents of the plugin.xml.\n\nIf is is a standalone Java application where you use parts of Eclipse as a library, that is a totally different story.\n",
    "Are you sure that you are using eclipse 3.1.2?\nThe build id indicates: M200409161125 which precedes eclipse 3.1.",
    "I found the solution for this.\nIn fact, with Eclipse 3.0 plugin jar files, following property of commented in config.ini file\nosgi.bundles\u003dorg.eclipse.core.runtime@2:start, org.eclipse.update.configurator@3:start\n\nBut, I found that with eclipse 3.1.2 plugin jar files, I need to uncomment the above property in config.ini file"
