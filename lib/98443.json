    "This is a major problem because you cannot get access to the entire help system.\nI am currently using 3.1RC1-1 but this bug also applies to 3.1\n\nThere is quite a lot of debug info which I am going to email to you at\nplatform-help-inbox@eclipse.org as soon as I have a bug report number.",
    "eclipse Bugzilla 98443 Help File System broken\n From: Vizion \u003cvizion@vizion.occoxmail.com\u003e\n To: freebsd-java@freebsd.org\n \nI have now distilled the information on the eclipse help bug which has now \nbeen posted to eclipse bugzilla under the reference number above.\n\nBug Report details\nSubject: eclipse Bugzilla 98443 Help File System broken\nDate: Sunday 05 June 2005 09:22\nFrom: Vizion \u003cvizion@vizion.occoxmail.com\u003e\nTo: zhoujx@cn.ibm.com, kowalski@us.ibm.com, mfaraj@ca.ibm.com, \nkonradk@ca.ibm.com, dejan@ca.ibm.com, dejan@ca.ibm.com, \nplatform-help-inbox@eclipse.org,  freebsd-java@freebsd.org, Alex Varju \n\u003calex@varju.ca\u003e\n\nHi\nOk this bug is causing a number of people considerable grief..there seems to\nbe something wrong with the way in which the help system operates. I am\nincluding in this email as much information as seems relevant but more is\navailable if required. Therre have been a series of emails which have been\nmade on freebsd-java@freebsd.org and on the eclipse newsgroup which are quite\nlengthy but the essential information is in this report.\nThe platform is PC and in my case the operating system is FreeBSD 5.3.\nalex@varju.ca is included in the distribution list as the freebsd maintainer\nfor the eclipse port.\nInformation now follows:\n\nA.

    "FreeBSD is not the supported OS for Eclipse 3.1. ",
    "1. Start with known help issues in Eclipse readme.\n3. (2 might be same problem) a java.io.tmpdir property must point to a \nwritable location.",
    "(In reply to comment #2)\n\u003e FreeBSD is not the supported OS for Eclipse 3.1.\n\nec lipse is open source software and is java. Both criteria mean that the\nconcept of \"unsuported OS\" is irrelevant - especially as the identical bug is\ntop be found on other platforms. The source code is open source - itmay be true\nthat siome people working on the project are not themselves familiar with\nFreeBSD but the FreeBSD eclipse project maintainer is familiar with with\nfreebsd. Please let us concentrate on having fun and providing mutual support\nwithin the open source community. This source code was donated by ibm to the\nopen source community and therefore belo0ngs to everyone.\n\n",
    "Absolutely. But there is a difference between the Eclipse community as a whole \nand the current Eclipse project committers. The later have taken on a task to \nproduce a release on a set schedule that is tested on a predetermined set of \nOS/WS/JRE combinations. We are interested in porting Eclipse to other \nplatforms but that would require contributions from others. In case of help \nsystem, we are not seeing the reported problem on the supported platforms, so \nit must be something specific to your OS configuration.

    "(In reply to comment #5)\n\u003e Absolutely. But there is a difference between the Eclipse community as a whole \n\u003e and the current Eclipse project committers. The later have taken on a task to \n\u003e produce a release on a set schedule that is tested on a predetermined set of \n\u003e OS/WS/JRE combinations.

In case of help \n\u003e system, we are not seeing the reported problem on the supported platforms, \n\nThis statement is BS- \nI have people in touch with me reporting the same problem on windows systems and\nclaiming that you guys are refusing to deal seriously with this bug that they\nfind to be irritating. How would you feel if one of your eclipse users reported\na bug in a tool that they use (e.g. tomcat or apache) that impacted your work. A\nbug is a bug whoever reports it. Unless your team have deliberately included\ncode that is designed to differentiate between operating systems then being in\njava should make no differece\n\nso \n\u003e it must be something specific to your OS configuration.\n\nThat is wishful thinking. \nThe port is open and listening.\nThe brwoser caLLis to Mozilla 5+ browser.\nThe browser is asking for what appears to be the correct URI\neclipse is communicating with the browser\nWhereas Version M7 did not work with the overview the fix to M7 incorporated in\nRC1 dealt with the problem with the overview screen.\nAs Konrad says it looks as though you have the same bug in the help system.\nThis is not just a FreeBSD bug -- it is a bug in a eclipse core utility.\nThis attempt to defer attention to this bug hurts not only freebsd users but\nalso win XP users\n---\nThe system is Not as far as I can see - the \nWe will be more than \n\u003e happy to accept a patch once you investigate the priblem and find the cause.\n\nIf the code was written to java standards there would be no problem - I have\nhundreds of java programs which run on other native platforms (including linux\nand Win XP without problem on Freebsd .. SDK5 from sun runs fine. So please do\nnot make statements you cannot prove to justify what appears to be IBM driven\ndiscrimination).\nThis attitude sounds more like corporate divisive speak which conveniently\nignore the fact that the same bug appears on win xp rather than open source\ncommunity co\u003doperation.  \n\n \n\u003e Failing that, we must limit our cycles to ensuring that Help works on the \n\u003e platforms set out in advance in the 3.1 plan. After the release, we well have \n\u003e more time to assist you in your efforts.\n\nThis sounds like condescending BS. \n\nLet us try and co-operate\nYou have the event details.\nPlease, in your own interests take a look at them, and tell me why it must be an\nOS issue and what is going wrong. \nIn view of the many reports from other OS users of the same problem I feekl you\nshould be thanking me from providing you with detailed reports rather than\ntrying to divide the open source community in this way.\n\n",

    "From Eclipse Platform\u0027s 3.1 test plan:\n\n\u003cquote\u003e\nThere are many different implementations of the Java 2 Platform running atop a \nvariety of operating systems. We focus Eclipse testing on a handful of popular \ncombinations of operating system and Java 2 Platform; these are our reference \nplatforms. Eclipse undoubtedly runs fine in many operating environments beyond \nthe reference platforms we test. However, since we do not systematically test \nthem we cannot vouch for them. Problems encountered when running Eclipse on \nnon-reference platform that cannot be recreated on any reference platform will \nbe given lower priority than problems with running Eclipse on a reference \nplatform.\n\u003c/quote\u003e\n\nPlease stop dragging companies Eclipse committers happen to work for into this \ndiscussion. All Eclipse committers operate strictly according to the Eclipse \nProject Charter and the current project plans. According to the snippet above, \nit is a declared fact that we will give lower priority to problems occuring on \nnon-reference platforms. Lower priority means that we will look at them during \nnormal bug triage at non-peak periods. We are at the final stages of the 3.1 \nrelease and must make hard choices regarding what to look at and what to defer \nfor after 3.1. It happens all the time and your problem is just one of them.\n\nWe did find bugs in tomcat and lucene open source software we used. Because it \nwas important to us, we provided a fix and contributed the fix back into the \nrespective OS community.",
