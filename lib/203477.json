    "The transportation network implementation right now is unclear. We are making efforts to define a way of implementing the transportation network that is simple and allows for disease transmission during transportations and will require a minimum of modification for new models.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d79145)\nOutline of the two different types of transportation networks\n\nDefines \"Packet Style\" and \"Pipe Style\" transpotation networks.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d79786)\nOutline of two different types of transporatiation networks\n\nRe attaching as a binary file",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d83161)\nPatch containing new edge definitions\n\nNew Edges attached to the existing project",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d83162)\nZIP file containing exported new projects for the transport network\n\nContains the new transport projects defining the network",
    "Added two new edge types to the definitions project and a new project defining packet style and pipe style transportation networks as described in the files. To apply changes one must both apply the patch and import the new projects.",
    "committed the patch and new projects, but I forgot to run org.eclipse.ohf.stem.tests.definitions (as a Junit Plugin test).  That test failed with missing class definition exceptions.  After adding missing dependencies to the Manifest.MF file it ran, but with JUnit failures.",
    "The repository version for me has build failures. Once I fix these it runs with no unit test failures.",
