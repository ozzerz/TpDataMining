    "This is new to 3.0RC1.

    "Bummer that we fail with an NPE. should fix that.\n\nWhat is the product set to?  What is that product\u0027s applicatoin defined as?\n\nThe short answer is yes, there is no default application.  The config.ini that \nwe ship with identifies org.eclpise.platform as the product.  This should \nidentify the appropriate application.  If there is something wrong in that \nchain, no application will be defined and Eclipse will not know what to do.",
    "The product is set to my branding plugin - which I don\u0027t believe sets an\napplication (hence the NPE).  How do I define an application in my branding\nplugin?  DO I have to extend the org.eclipse.core.runtime.applications and set\nit to org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench?",
    "BTW - I know this is something I am doing wrong (failing to define the app), btu\nit worked fine in M9 so I never noticed...",
    "OK - I thought I figured it out - just specify\napplication\u003d\"org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\" in feature.xml like the\norg.eclipse.platform feature does.  Well, unfortunately that doesn\u0027t work\neither.  It still crashes with a NPE unless I explicitly set\neclipse.application\u003dorg.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench in config.ini.  This isn\u0027t too\nbog of a deal but I would like to know why the org.eclipse.platform feature gets\naway with it and I can\u0027t.\n",
    "yes, it did work previously because Update wsa being helpful.  This caused \nother problems so they backed off.\n\nI suspect you are splitting the idea and defining a product extension and then \ntrying to spec some of the required info in a feature somehow.  You only have \nto list the id of the application in the markup for your product. \n   \u003cproduct application\u003d\"some app id here\" name\u003d\"some name\"\u003e\nshould do fine.\n\n",
    "Are things working for you now?",
    "Actually - I think specifying application\u003d in feature.xml worked.  I think it\nappeared *not* to work before because of some sort of caching going on with the\nplatform.  It seems that after unzipping a fresh runtime and inserting my\nproduct branding plugins, the problem went away.\n\nI haven\u0027t gone back and verified that the removing it and installing with a\nfresh platform reproduced the NPE.  Sorry - if I get time I\u0027ll try to verify\nwhat exactly fixed my problem.",
    "really closing this time...",
    "sigh.  Bugzilla and its driving need to advance you to the next bug report.  \nreopening...",
    "*** Bug 67727 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Things appear to be working as designed so we are closing this bug.\n\nBefore closing however, I want to put in a null check so that the failure mode \nis more like \"application null not found\" rather than an NPE.  This is somewhat \nmore informative to the user and will thus save some time and frustration \n(hopefully).\n\n",
    "+1 to fix and release for RC3.",
    "I can confirm that this is a duplicate.  I tried the work arounds mentioned \nbelow and my primary feature started.  The key was to specify \napplication\u003d\"org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\" in the feature.xml and config.ini.\n\nI note also that our preferred perspective is now coming up correctly for the \nfirst time!",
    "The null check has een released.  Closing as fixed.\n\nPhil, I am very curious if you had to specify the app in both the feature and \nthe config.ini.  This should not be the case and in fact, is not the case for \nthe Eclipse SDK.  ",
    "I found I had to specify the feature and app in config.ini\n\nThis was not necessary in M8 where I only specified the feature.",
