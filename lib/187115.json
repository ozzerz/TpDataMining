    "The original problem (got \"Invalid thread access\" error) had been fixed in RSE-SDK-I20070514-1630 driver.  \n\nBut I still got error:\n\nRSE1306E: Copy of file or folder epdcdump01.hex failed.\nDetails: The file system reported the copy operation failed.  You may not have authority to the target folder, or it maybe in use.\n\nBut if I copied this file outside the folder, and then copied it and pasted it back to the folder, I did not get this error.  \nIt seems the error only happened when I copied a file and pasted it back to the folder it belonged to.\n\n\n\n",
    "Xuan, I believe that Javier fixed this in a later driver. Can you please try with I20070517-0600 and if you still see it, re-open this bug or file a new one if you think it\u0027s a different issue than the one originally handled by this bug.",
    "I tried this and it works with todays driver.",
    "I just tried RSE-SDK-I20070517-0600.zip driver, but this problem has not been totally fixed yet.\n\nIn my folder, I had two files, one was a .txt file, and one is a .zip file.\n\nI copied the .txt file and then pasted it back to it parent folder.\nGot the dialog for overwrite.  I clicked OK, and it was fine.\nThen I copied the .zip file, also pasted it back to its parent folder.\nGot the dialog for overwriting.  I click OK, and I got the same error as before again.\nNow, if I copied the .txt file and pasted it back to the parent directory, I got the same error as before.  ",
    "Will investigate for RC1.",
    "Copying a file from one folder and trying to paste it back to that folder will cause an error.  cp on linux won\u0027t let you do that as well as xcopy.  \n\nOn Linux:\ncp: `Testing.txt\u0027 and `/home2/kjdoyle/testing/Testing.txt\u0027 are the same file\n\nOn Windows:\nFile cannot be copied onto itself.\n\nIdeally overwrite should be disabled on the dialog that appears.",
    "I see what Xuan is talking about and I tried to do a couple of tests myself.  What I have found from this seems to be pretty normal behaviour as commented by Kevin.  Maybe changing the error message that is produced would be better to inform the user of what is occuring.  \n\nInstance1:\nIt seems that when you try and copy and paste the file from and to the parent directory and error is produced saying:\n\n\"Copy of the file or folder rupen failed\"  \n\nDetails : \"The file system reported the copy operation failed. You may not have authority to the target folder, or it may be in use\"\n\nWhich in my opinion seems normal because the user is attempting to copy and paste the file to and from the exact same location (which would never really have to be done).\n\nInstance2:\nThe second instance when the file is first copied to another folder and then copied over to the parent directory from there makes sense.  It\u0027s just a simple overwrite where the two files can have the same name but different contents. In the first instance the both files have the same content becuase they are the same file from the same location.\n",
    "The original problem here (with the invalid thread access) was fixed so I think we should close this and open an enhancement for providing a better error message.",
    "Closing since this problem was fixed.",
    "Verified the invalid thread access problem has been fixed in 0713 2.0.1 driver.\n"
