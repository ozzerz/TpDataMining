    "I use Eclipse 3.0M4 and wrote different classes in my workspace. I also use \noften a package i wrote, the packagename is \"ch.rolandschaer.myUtil\". I \nattached the JAR file to the JRE standarf library, this way it\u0027s available in \neach new project. \nWhen i upgraded to the new release M5 i always get a NoClassDefFound Error in \neach project i import this package. The weird thing is that the error seems to \ncome from the compiler not from Eclipse itself.",
    "Do you have a stack trace or log file with more details?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d7214)\nSample project with package\n\nThe error i get when i run this application is:\n\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: ch/rolandschaer/myUtil/Text\n\tat Main.main(Main.java:30)\nException in thread \"main\" ",
    "The JRE system library path is used at compile time only.  If you add JARs to\nthat set, you will be able to compile against the extra JAR, but not run it.  If\nyou want extra JARs to be globally available at run-time, then you have to use\none of the mechanisms that the VM provides for doing this.  To add JARs to the\nruntime classpath, you need to add it to the boot classpath.  For most VMs this\nis done with the \"-Xbootclasspath\" command line argument.  Read your VM\ndocumentation for more details.",
    "Ok. But why this worked in the Eclipse M4 release? Was this a lack which \nyou\u0027ve fixed now?"
