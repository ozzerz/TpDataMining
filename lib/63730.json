    "This bug has not seen any activity in 2 years and we have not had other reports of similar failures. If you are still experiencing the failure, please reopen with the the steps to reprodice on a ecent Eclipse build (preferably 3.2).",
    "Our usual practice is to move bugs to the RESOLVED REMIND state when there is not enough information provided to address the reported issue and more information has been requested. This bug has been in the RESOLVED REMIND state for quite some time so it is being CLOSED. If you can provide the requested information or you otherwise feel that this is still an issue, please reopen the bug. If you are unable to open it due to a lack or permissions, please add a comment to the bug stating that you would like to have the request reconsidered.  I applogize for this blanket approach to bug screening but there are just to many bugs in the REMIND state for us to effectively triage them. Your help in this matter is appreciated."
