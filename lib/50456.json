    "When the log shows a class cast exception, it does not show the class involved \nin the assignment. Knowing those classes would greatly help in figuring out \nwhat goes wrong.",
    "We just print exception stack traces.  Whether the class name is included in the\nstack trace is up to the VM/class library that you\u0027re using. If this information\nisn\u0027t in the stack trace, then we have no way to compute it.",
    "But I do not think you are printing the message of the exception? It just says \njava.lang.ClassCastException and normally I see the name of the casted class.",
    "We do not print the exception message. We just call\nThrowable#prinStackTrace(PrintWriter) on the exception object. As John said,\nwhat that does will depend on the VM/class library implementation, but it\nusually prints the exception message.\n\nBTW, in what VM are you seeing this? Can you reproduce with different VMs?",
    "I tried it again and it is not for all ClassCastExceptions. The Java VM is SUN \n1.4.2_03. The message really is:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.exports.PluginExportWizardPage.getListElemen\nts(PluginExportWizardPage.java:49)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.wizards.exports.BaseExportWizardPage$ExportListProvi\nder.getElements(BaseExportWizardPage.java:70)\n\n\nAs you can see there is no text. However, my VM normally shows a text when it \nis there. Could it be a nested exception that is handled wrongly?",
    "The only reason I can see for that to be happening is that (for some unknown\nreason) the ClassCastException object does not have the class name in its\nmessage (or does not have a message).",
    "Just checked the Java spec to see if it may be VM dependent -\nThrowable.printStackTrace is spec\u0027d to call toString() on the exception, which\nsays it always prints the message. If you had a test case that we could try...",
    "Found these two PRs on Sun bug database:\n\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4488551.html\n    RFE: More explicit error msg on ClassCastException\n\nhttp://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4921296.html\n    ClassCastException needs more verbose detailMessage\n\nClosing as invalid (VM bug/limitation)."
