    "Build: F2\nI can no longer run my target workbench.  I get the following exception in my \ndev workbench when I try to run the target:\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.activateDefaultPlugins\n(InternalPlatform.java:113)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.loaderStartup\n(InternalPlatform.java:554)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.startup\n(InternalBootLoader.java:873)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.run\n(InternalBootLoader.java:732)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader.run(BootLoader.java:432)\n\tat EclipseRuntimeLauncher.main(EclipseRuntimeLauncher.java:24)\nException in thread \"main\" \n\n(in activateDefaultPlugins(), descriptor is null - that is what is causing the \nnull pointer exception)\n\nI will attach the contents of the log for the session.\n\nIn my development environment, I am using around 400 external plugins, \nincluding the eclipse base plugins.  There are about 20 projects in my \nworkpsace (session.txt).\n\nBefore this happened, I would close my target workbench and it would still \nappear to still be running in the Debug view, so i would terminate it.  Then I \nwould get an error that said there were problems terminating, even though the \ntarget workbench now appeared to be terminated in the Debug view.  \nI will attach what I think was written to the log when this happened (terminate-\nproblem.txt)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d1352)\nlog contents for corrupt ws\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d1353)\nlog contents for problem terminating target wb\n",
    "The corrupt workspace is in my public directory.  It is called runtime-\nworkspace.zip",
    "Registry file may be corrupt since i terminated the target while it was \nshutting down.  I have placed the .registry file, along with the corrupt \nworkspace .zip, in my public directory, in directory named with bug ID#.",
    "The runtime plugin was not in the plugin registry, which caused the NPE.  When I \ndeleted the .registry file, it started up with no further problems.",
    "Investigate for 2.0.\n\nLook at:\n- adding new writer (increment version id)\n- adding new reader\n- adding known bytes at end of file (4 3 2 1?) to ensure we have read the \nwhole registry cache",
    "Fix is even easier than expected. (gotta like it when that happens!)\n\nWe already serialize begin/end tags for the registry cache file. \n\nIf we read the end tag, then we returned the cache that we have read. \n\nIf we got an EOF exception then we returned what we had read. This is \nincorrect and should return \"no cached registry, please re-parse\". (read: null)\n\nFix ready to be reviewed and released.",
    "Fixed. Reviewed. Tested. Released."
