    "This should allow us to tag tests for which we know they are slower \nbecause of new functionality can be rendered in say gray rather then red.",
    "I added new API to the BarGraph to annoted results (and have negative results painted in grey instead of \nred). Need to figure out how to show the annotation and how to store it in the DB.\n\nSonia, how hard is it to implement a hover on the performance fingerprint graph so that the annotation \nis shown when hovering over the result?",
    "The only challenge here is to find a way to create the hover without having \nthe text truncated (bug 89805).  I use \"alt\" and \"title\" to create the hovers \nfor the line graphs, but these attributes are not sufficient for the job.\n ",
    "I got asked in the PMC call this morning, why we haven\u0027t implemented this.\n\nAndre, the anotation can be done with a hover, as you suggested. You probably want to have the text \nthat is returned be something like:\n    This performance comparison is no longer valid. Reason:\n    ...\n\nAre you still hung up trying to figure out how to store the data in the database? If so, who do you need \nto talk to to get that solved?",
    "Basically, I\u0027ll have to talk to myself :-)\nWill do tonight...",
    "I hope to have this fixed today.",
    "I\u0027ve added support for \"summary comments\" to the performance plugin.\nThe basic idea is to set a comment on the PerformanceMeter\nin a similar way as the tagging for performance summary is done:\n\nPerformanceMeter pm\u003d ...\nPerformance.getDefault().setComment(pm, EXPLAINS_DEGRADATION_COMMENT, \"a comment...\")\n\nAt the other end both the comment kind and the comment text is available as instance variables of the \nSummaryEntry.\n\nSonia, could you please feed this in the BarGraph API.\n\nI ran a lot of test on a local database, but since I don\u0027t have access to the Ottawa DB, I\u0027m not sure \nwhether the DB upgrade code will work. So please report all suspicious messages immediately.\n\nI\u0027ll add a setComment call to the Compare performance test so that you can verify that a comment \ncomes through...",
    "I notice build N20050429-0010 has a number of these exceptions:\n\njavax/naming/NamingException \n\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/naming/NamingException\nat com.ibm.db2.jcc.c.pb.a(pb.java:206)\nat com.ibm.db2.jcc.c.n.h(n.java:251)\nat com.ibm.db2.jcc.c.n.\u003cclinit\u003e(n.java:239)\nat com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver.\u003cclinit\u003e(DB2Driver.java:39)\nat java.lang.Class.forName0(Native Method)\nat java.lang.Class.forName(Class.java:141)\nat org.eclipse.test.internal.performance.db.DB.connect(DB.java:662)\nat org.eclipse.test.internal.performance.db.DB.getDefault(DB.java:257)\nat org.eclipse.test.internal.performance.db.DB.store(DB.java:225)\nat org.eclipse.test.internal.performance.InternalPerformanceMeter.commit\n(InternalPerformanceMeter.java:80)\nat org.eclipse.test.performance.PerformanceTestCase.commitMeasurements\n(PerformanceTestCase.java:137)\nat \norg.eclipse.ant.tests.ui.editor.performance.OpenAntEditorTest.measureOpenInEdit\nor(OpenAntEditorTest.java:87)\nat .....",
    "The excpetions your are seeing aren\u0027t related to the \"slow down explained\" feature, because I\u0027ve \nchecked in the code one hour ago. So the nightly build ran a version of the performance plugin that \nhadn\u0027t changed for weeks.",
    "I\u0027ve released changes to show bar graphs/x\u0027s in grey for scenarios with \nannotations.  I still do not have support to show the comment in a hover on an \nimage map, so I have placed the comments at the top of the details scenario \nresults page for now.  Still need to verify, not sure if anyone is using \nannotations right now.",
    "We need to be able to annotate any performance tests, not only summary tests. Is\nthere any technical limitation to making it that way?\n\nFor instance, I would expect that on the table that shows detailed information\nabout the test results (scenarios vs configurations), the hover tip for failures\nwould show the degradation explanation instead of the standard message:\n\"Performance criteria not met when compared to...\".",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d21216)\nscreenshot\n",
    "Sonia we have a situation because of platform differences in SWT where we are\nway faster on windows and slightly slower on Linux so we are going to make an\nexplanation.\n\nWe would like it so that a succeeding test is always green and a failure with\nexplanation is grey. Is this possible?",
    "This is the way it works currently : )",
    "As an aside (and not a comment about this particular case), I think it\u0027s bogus in general to flag a test as \ngray if we fail it and green if we pass _by_default_. We should treat grayed tests as meaning \"something \nhappened which invalidates this test\", not \"if it\u0027s slower, it\u0027s not our fault\".",
    "We should also not force it to be a fingerprint test - a grey X in the results\nwould be better.",
    "Is this going to happen for 3.1? We need to know what to do with our tests for\nFriday. We don\u0027t want to ship with red X\u0027s. (grey is fine)",
    "Sonia and I have implemented the \"slow down explained\" tag for fingerprints only (since that was the \noriginal request).\nTo add them to all tests (as asked for in comment #15) is more involved and won\u0027t happen for 3.1.",
    "What is the recommended action for non-fingerprint tests which are known to be\nslower? Do we ship with red X\u0027s for 3.1?",
    "If we shipped nothing red, then people would assume we were cheating. If you feel the test is no longer \nshowing useful information, then definitely remove it. Otherwise, I\u0027d just leave it.",
    "has been implemented some time ago..."
