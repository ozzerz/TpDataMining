    "The exception below seems to be happening with any .lst file:\n\nMessage: NullPointerException thrown: null\nStack trace: java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat\norg.aspectj.ajde.internal.CompilerAdapter.configureBuildOptions(CompilerAdapter.java:296)\n\tat\norg.aspectj.ajde.internal.CompilerAdapter.genBuildConfig(CompilerAdapter.java:170)\n\tat org.aspectj.ajde.internal.CompilerAdapter.compile(CompilerAdapter.java:95)\n\tat\norg.aspectj.ajde.internal.AspectJBuildManager$CompilerThread.run(AspectJBuildManager.java:191)",
    "we have many tests in the suite that use lst files, and AJDT uses lst files to\ndrive the compiler too - could you give a few more details about the command\nline or ant options you are using to kick off the compiler please? sounds like\nyou could easily create a small self-contained test to reproduce this? If so,\nadding that as an attachment to this bug report would be very helpful.\n\nthks, Adrian.",
    "As Adrian points out it would be very useful to know what options you are using,\nbecause it seems that no source compliance option is being set.  Since it\u0027s\nok to fall back to a default compliance I have added the following guard to\nprevent this NPE:\n\nif (optionsToSet.containsKey(CompilerOptions.OPTION_Compliance))\n{...}\n",
    "I followed the following steps:\n1. Ran \"java -jar aspectjtools.jar\" \n2. Selected a build configuration and supplied a .lst file with one test class\nin it.\n3. Attempted to build a configuration. This step failed with AJDE error window\ndisplaying the NPE.",
    "Roman, this should be resolved now and I was able to successfully compile\ntypical .lst files with the browser.  If the browser still doesn\u0027t work\nfor you on the next release please reopen the report and post the first \nfew lines of the .lst file that you are building."
