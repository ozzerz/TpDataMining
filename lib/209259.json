    "Build ID: 4.4.0.3\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nIn order to use the IAC it must be configured prior to initial  \nuse.  The \"lib\" directory and its contained file \"config.jar\" is missing in the following locations:\nTPTP 4.4.0.3\neclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.tptp.platform.ac.win_ia32_4.4.1.v200709261752\\agent_controller\n\nTPTP 4.4.1\neclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.tptp.platform.ac.win_ia32_4.4.0.v200706020100\\agent_controller\n\nMore information:\nThis problem exists in both version 4.4.0.3 and 4.4.1.\nThe problem exists in both sdk and runtime distributions.\n\nAlso note that the version of the agent controller in 4.4.1 is older than the version distributed with the previous release 4.4.0.3.\n\nNote: Temporary workaround - Download and install the standalone agent controller, configure it and start prior to each eclipse instance where you wish to use TPTP features that depend on the AgentController.",
    "I thought I\u0027d add that the \"lib\" directory and its contents are also missing in the following directory too:\n\neclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.tptp.platform.ac.win_em64t_4.4.1.v200709261752\\agent_controller",
    "I\u0027m using Linux (Novel Suse), and also have config.jar missing from the agent_controller directory.",

    "Hi Bing. I have transferred my bugs to you for triage. Thanks.",
    "Config.jar is removed from Internal Agent Controller because it\u0027s no longer needed.  Internal Agent Controller is configured through Eclipse Preference and the config file is generated by a java class.\n\nJim and Jack, did you encounter problem configuring the Internal Agent Controller?\n",
    "I\u0027ve reviewed the configuration/missing JAR file\nIn my original investigation I made the mistake of assuming that the problem was being caused by a lack of configuration.\n\nThis is what I see (confirming that configuration is actually working)\n1. Install eclipse.\n2. Install TPTP 4.4.0.3.\n3. Install TPTP AGR 4.4.0.3.\n4. Create an AGR Testcase\n5. Select AGR Testcase and \"Run As... Test\" (This should start the AgentController - and if necessary configure it first)\n6. The ACServer.exe does start and I can confirm that the resultant serviceconfig.xml is valid.\n\nHowever, the resultant ACServer.exe is not usable.\nIt gives the following error when attempting to run the AGR test (Step 5 above): \n\nIWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:Connection refused on host localhost.\n\nThe .log file contains the following:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.hyades.test.core 4 0 2007-11-30 10:05:22.317\n!MESSAGE IWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:Connection refused on host localhost.\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.hyades.test.core 1 0 2007-11-30 10:09:50.399\n!MESSAGE org.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.DaemonConnectException\n!STACK 0\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.DaemonConnectException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl._connect(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$4.run(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n\nCaused by: org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.ProcessImpl.getProcessId(Unknown Source)\n\t... 5 more\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.hyades.test.core 4 0 2007-11-30 10:09:50.430\n!MESSAGE IWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:Connection refused on host localhost.\n\nQUESTION:\nShould I raise a new defect against this problem or am I missing something simple?",
    "Hi Jim, can you attach your config file at \u003cEclipse Root\u003e\\plugins\\org.eclipse.tptp.platform.ac.win_ia32_4.4.0.v200706020100\\agent_controller\\config.  Do you have security enabled?  What\u0027s your Eclipse runtime JRE?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d84183)\nAttaching IAC configuration file as requested\n\n",

    "Jim,\n\nFrom the config file, security seems has been enabled.   Can you try IAC without security disabled.   You can set it using Eclipse-\u003ePreference-\u003eAgent Controller.\n\nAnd can you ping localhost on your machine?   ",
    "Security is definitely disabled in the UI.\ni.e. in \"Windows --\u003e Preferences --\u003e Agent Controller --\u003e Integrated Agent Controller\" the \"Integrated Agent Controller security\" is set to \"Off\".\n\nI changed the serviceconfig.xml entry by hand as follows:\n\u003cSecurityEnabled\u003efalse\u003c/SecurityEnabled\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve confirmed the \"ping\":\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\jhayko\u003eping localhost\n\nPinging tpjhayko [127.0.0.1] with 32 bytes of data:\n\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes\u003d32 time\u003c1ms TTL\u003d128\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes\u003d32 time\u003c1ms TTL\u003d128\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes\u003d32 time\u003c1ms TTL\u003d128\nReply from 127.0.0.1: bytes\u003d32 time\u003c1ms TTL\u003d128\n\nPing statistics for 127.0.0.1:\n    Packets: Sent \u003d 4, Received \u003d 4, Lost \u003d 0 (0% loss),\nApproximate round trip times in milli-seconds:\n    Minimum \u003d 0ms, Maximum \u003d 0ms, Average \u003d 0ms\n\n\nAttempting to run test still gives the following error:\nIWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:Connection refused on host localhost.\n\n",
    "Jim,  can you try the following:\n\n1. Change your IAC setting through Preference and see if the config file gets updated.  For example, disable the IAC.\n\n2. Kill the ACServer and then create a new \u0027External Java Application\u0027 profile case, select \u0027localhost\u0027 and click \u0027Test Connection\u0027, see if you get \u0027Connection success\u0027 popup.  And check if the ACServer process is started.\n",
    "Bing,\n\nIf I change preferences the config file is updated correctly.\n\nI have create a new \u0027External Java Application\u0027 profile, selected \u0027localhost\u0027 and clicked \u0027Test Connection\u0027. \n\nI do get the \u0027Connection success\u0027 popup.\n\n",
    "Jim, can we resolve this defect now or do you feel a tech note is still necessary?",
    "Hi Jim,\n\nCan you try doing the same steps with another test type such as Junit plugin test?\nAlso, if you select the test invocation and create a new launch configuration for the AGR test and then run it, does this succeed?\n",
    "I think it is reasonable to mark this defect as resolved.\nThere is no technote required for RSx 7.0.5 products.\n\nI will continue to pursue this issue under a new defect \"AGR cannot connect to AgentController\".",
    "I have created a new bug: 211927 that more accurately reflects the problem I am experiencing: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d211927\n\nMarking this bug as INVALID as the problem as described does not exist."
