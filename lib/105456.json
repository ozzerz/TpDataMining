    "Holding one of the step keys down (to step as quickly as possible) can cause a \nNPE in the step action\u0027s job.\n\nThis is the stack entry in the .log file\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 2005-07-28 10:39:14.783\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Step Over\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.actions.AbstractDebugActionDelegate$DebugRequestJ\nob.run(AbstractDebugActionDelegate.java:143)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:76)\n\nThis problem appears to be caused by the following:\n1) The debug core is reusing the same instance of the background job to carry \nout the action.\n2) Just before scheduling the job the selected elements are \"set\" in the \ninstance of the job. then the job is scheduled.\n3) if a second job is scheduled before the first has had a chance to run then \nthe job instance will be set to the 2nd set of selected elements.   \n\u003e\u003e the first set will be lost\n4) the first job will then run and execute the action for the 2nd set\n5) the second job will then run and get a null set of selected elements (hence \nthe npe error)",
