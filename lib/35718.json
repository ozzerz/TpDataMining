    "Is there anything special about the path where eclipse is installed?  I\u0027m\nthinking of strange characters such as \"!@#$%^\u0026\" or UNC paths.",
    "This has been reported in the past but we have never been able to reproduce it.\n We should at least add more diagnostic information in the error log in this\ncase so we can debug it further.  \n\nDarryl, if you try running again but add the \"-debug\" command line argument and\nstart with java.exe instead of javaw.exe, what do you see in the console view?\n\nFor example, run \"eclipse.exe -vm d:\\jre\\bin\\java.exe -debug\"",
    "got it sorted now.  Thanks",
    "Can you give us a quick idea of what was wrong?  We get this same bug report\nfrom time to time but don\u0027t know what\u0027s causing it.  This would help us save\npeople from grief if it happens again.",
    "Closing this bug, but please let us know what the problem was if you can.",
    "I\u0027ve just hit this one also, and Rafael Chaves asked me to put the relevant info\nhere. I\u0027m running Eclipse 2.1 on WinXP, installed in my c:\\eclipse.org\ndirectory. I also installed Java 1.3 along with IBM\u0027s Websphere Preview\nTechnologies. I\u0027m running it by double-clicking a shortcut created by\nalt-dragging eclipse.exe to my desktop, and I\u0027ve not modified any of the\nshortcut preferences.\n\nI started hitting this problem after this sequence of events:\n1) Install eclipse 2.1\n2) Install Websphere stuff and Java\n -- everything worked at this point --\n3) Mess up the eclipse directory structure by incorrectly unzipping examples\n4) Attempt to fix (3) by uninstalling and re-installing eclipse.\n\nNow I hit the error every time.",
    "Michael, if you edit your eclipse.exe shortcut and add the \"-debug\" command line\nparameter, what do you see in the console?  It should tell you where it\u0027s\nlooking for the bootstrapping code.  Your shortcut \"Target\" should look\nsomething like this:\n\nD:\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe -debug -vm d:\\jre\\bin\\java.exe\n\nThis might help us figure out what went wrong.",
    "Michael, could you comment on John\u0027s question above? Thanks.",
    "I\u0027m having trouble getting the info you want...\n\nFirst off, let me apologize for the incorrect information in my previous update.\nThe directory where Eclipse.exe is located is c:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org. My\nshortcut target doesn\u0027t contain a -vm switch, so I added your debug switch and\nit looks like this:\n\n\"C:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org\\eclipse.exe\" -debug\n\nNow when I double-click the shortcut, I got a DOS window that flashes some text\ntoo quickly to read, and the same entry in the .log file.",
    "I\u0027m reopening this bug, because we should at least be giving a more informative\nerror message in this case.\n\nMichael, can you try this:\n\n- Open a Windows Command Prompt\n- go to the eclipse install directory (cd \"c:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org\\eclipse\")\n- type the following:\n\njava -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main -debug\n\nThis will run Eclipse in the same command shell, and you should be able to see\nthe error message correctly.\n\n",
    "John, here\u0027s what it shows:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org\u003ejava -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main\n -debug\nStartup: unable to load configuration\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org\\.config\\platform.cfg\n (The system cannot find the path specified)\n\nC:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org\u003e",
    "By looking through our startup code, the only possiblity seems to be that the\nboot plugin is indeed missing.  If you look in your install directory\n\"eclipse.org\", you should see a jar called startup.jar, and a sub-directory\ncalled \"plugins\".  This directory should contain a sub-directory called\n\"org.eclipse.core.boot_2.1.0\".  Do you see this?  If not, you\u0027ve really messed\nup your install.",
    "Ahh... I *had* messed up the install, but I still don\u0027t know how I did what I\ndid. What I\u0027ve ended up with is c:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org containing\neclipse.exe, startup.jar, etc. I also have c:\\Program Files\\eclipse.org\\eclipse,\nwhich contains the same files... it\u0027s *this* directory that has the \\plugins\nsubdirectory. The shortcut I had been using was to eclipse.exe in the\n\\eclipse.org directory; when I made a new one to\n\\eclipse.org\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe, everything works as advertised.\n\nGo ahead and change the error message if you want to. I\u0027m back in business and\ngrateful for your help. I\u0027m available to test a fix, if you need me to. My own\ntwo cents is that the message shouldn\u0027t refer to the -boot switch if it\u0027s\ndeprecated.",
    "Old summary: Could not find bootstrap code\n\nNeed to change the error message to reference -configuration.",
    "I had the same problem and the comments entered for this item helped me to \nidentify the problem.  There were two things that I did wrong when I installed \nthe Eclipse software:\n\n1.  I copied the .ZIP file into the \\Eclipse folder that I created.\n    I should have extracted the files from the root folder on the drive\n    (I\u0027m using Windows 2000 Professional) and let WinZip create the \n    Eclipse folder and the sub-folders.\n2.  I didn\u0027t have WinZip set up to use the folder names defined in the\n    .ZIP file.  As a result, the sub-folders in the \\Eclipse folder were\n    not created.\n\nSolution:\n1.  Extract the files from the .ZIP file from the root folder and let\n    the WinZip software create the Eclipse folder for you.\n2.  Make sure that WinZip will use the folder names in the .ZIP file.\n    When extracting, make sure that the \"Use Folder Names\" check box\n    is checked.",

The directory structure was *NOT* the problem in this \ncase though it generates the same error, as many of the others that had this \nproblem were stating. The problem, as noted by Peter Tiedmann was fixed by \nmapping the somecomputer to a local drive, i.e., Y:\\eclipse. This solved it \nright away and up opened Eclipse. Why this is the case is beyond me, but it\u0027s \na tricky little bug when you don\u0027t know what is going on.",
