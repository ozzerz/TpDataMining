    "Are you sure that you downloaded the Eclipse SDK and not the Eclipse RCP\nFramework? The RCP framework does not include an application and you will get\nthis message when trying to run it.\n",
    "yes i download 3.0 relese SDK from this link\nftp://download2.eclipse.org/R-3.0-200406251208/eclipse-SDK-3.0-win32.zip\n\nnow im back working with 3.0 RC3 until the bug will be fixed...\ncause 3.0RC3 works good for me",
    "Did you install the new version over-top of the old one or did you delete the\nold one first (or install the new one to a new directory)?",
    "i put it over the RC3 why?\nsould it make a diffarnce?",
    "Yes, this is usually the cause of many problems.\nPlease install eclipse in a new folder and then start.\nLet us know if this fixed the problem.",
    "This is the first time that installing a new build over an existing install has\never caused a problem for me.  Going forward, this is a difficult requirement to\nswallow.  I have many projects that I\u0027d rather not need to configure/import\nevery time a new Eclipse build comes out.",
    "This has always been the case since day 1. Many newsgroup post say that.\n\nInstalling eclipse in a new folder does not mean recreating a new workspace.\nIf you don\u0027t want to loose your workspace, on startup specify a location \noutside of your eclipse install (using the chooser) and then you can change \neclipse as many times as you want. This is typically the way we work around \nhere.\n\nYou can also specify -data \u003cyourWorkspace\u003e.\n\n\n",
    "As Pascal mentions, it has always been a requirement that you need to uninstall\nprevious releases or install a new release to a new directory.\n\nPlease refer to the README file in your install for more information.\n\n/eclipse/readme/readme_eclipse.html#Upgrading\n",
