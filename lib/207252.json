    "I\u0027m finding a very odd occurrence that I haven\u0027t been able to solve.  When I start the workbench with my view in a clean workspace the browser works, and I\u0027m able to collect some data from the browser and save that to a file.  When I close the workspace and open it again, (w/o cleaning the workspace) and open the file I saved, I get the following error and the browser doesn\u0027t render.  If I create a new clean workspace and copy my saved file in there and open it, the browser works.\n\nHow do I go about fixing this?  Any help is appreciated - I\u0027m not sure if this is a bug or if there is a workaround....  I searched for \"org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.\u003cinit\u003e(Browser.java:194)\" on google and got one entry reporting the same issue but no followup/responses.\n\norg.eclipse.swt.SWTError: No more handles\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:3400)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:3297)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:3268)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.\u003cinit\u003e(Browser.java:194)",
    "I did some more tracing and found something that maybe you can shed light on.  It seems to be with the OLE stuff.\n\nThe SWT Exception gets fired because OleControlSite:99 returns a bad result code:\n\nint result \u003d COM.OleCreate(appClsid, COM.IIDIUnknown, COM.OLERENDER_DRAW, null, 0, tempStorage.getAddress(), address);\nif (result !\u003d COM.S_OK)\n   OLE.error(OLE.ERROR_CANNOT_CREATE_OBJECT, result);\n\nIn my debugger, COM.OleCreate returns -2147221164 which causes the OLE.error command on line OleControlSite:101 to fire.  This triggers all the SWT exceptions up the stack.\n\nAny thoughts?\n",
    "I\u0027ve never heard of a problem like this before.  Questions:\n\n- what is the value of String progId that is passed to the OleControlSite constructor where the error occurs?\n\n- is this reproducable on other\u0027s machines?  Are you able to send the file that makes this happen so that I can try to reproduce it?\n\n- if you run regedit on your machine:\n  - what is the value of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\u003eShell.Explorer\u003eCLSID and HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\u003eShell.Explorer\u003eCurVer?\n  - do you have a registry entry whose name is the value of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\u003eShell.Explorer\u003eCurVer?  (eg.- this is typically Shell.Explorer.2)\n"
