    "CVS (http://www.cvshome.org) uses the connection parameter :ext: to specify an SSH based \nconnection. Eclipse inexplicably changed this to :extssh: which means any attempt to use a command \nline CVS tool (or any other standards-compliant tool) with an Eclipse project will not work:\n\nra:~/Workspace/Harmony zbeckman$ cvs status build.xml\ncvs status: unknown method in CVSroot: :extssh:zbeckman@led.godzilla.org:/home/cvsroot\ncvs [status aborted]: Bad CVSROOT.",
    "[does not seem to be Mac specific, changing platform/OS]",
    "The extssh connection method is a custom connection method in Eclipse that \nprovides SSH2 support without the use of an external client. If you want to \nuse extssh from within Eclipse but have your sandbix remain command line \ncompatible, you can configure the ext connection method in Eclipse to use \nextssh inside Eclipse. This can be done on the Team\u003eCVS\u003eExt Connection Method \npreference page. Once complete, you should use ext as the connection method of \nyour repository locaion inside Eclipse (and not extssh).",
    "Attempting to use the :ext: protocol has never worked for me. Eclipse generates an error message, but \ndoes not provide much detail. If I fill in exactly the same information as used with :extssh: I get the \nfollowing in the Eclipse log:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui 4 0 Sep 01, 2004 08:58:02.699!MESSAGE Internal error!STACK \n1org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSException: Unknown response received from cvs server:        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.client.Request.executeRequest(Request.java:234)        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.client.ValidRequests.execute(ValidRequests.java:26)        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.client.Session.open(Session.java:157)        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performUpdate(RemoteFold\nerMemberFetcher.java:115)        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation$InternalRemoteFolderMemberFetc\nher.performUpdate(FetchMembersOperation.java:67)        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolder\nMemberFetcher.java:82)        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolder\nMemberFetcher.java:73)        at \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation.execute(FetchMembersOperation.j\nava:105)        at org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.CVSOperation.run(CVSOperation.java:84)        \nat \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.model.RemoteFolderElement.fetchDeferredChildren(RemoteFolderElem\nent.java:71)        at \norg.eclipse.ui.progress.DeferredTreeContentManager$1.run(DeferredTreeContentManager.java:152)        \nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66)!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 -4 \nSep 01, 2004 08:58:02.701!MESSAGE Unknown response received from cvs server:\n\nThat\u0027s the entirity of it. Of course, I have triple-checked parameters, and command-line ssh and CVS \nintegration works just great. \n\nWhat I don\u0027t understand is why the internal Eclipse CVS would use :extssh: when it is in all other \nregards 100% compatible with the command line. I\u0027ve actually written a short perl script that scans my \nCVS/Root files and toggles between :ext: and :extssh: for just the purpose. I can \"workaround\" the \nproblem by using the internal Eclipse CVS/SSH integration, and use my script to \"toggle\" the :extssh: to \na simple :ext: and use my command line tools. But it\u0027s a pain, going back and forth.\n\nSo, bottom line: I still believe that :extssh: should be changed to simply :ext: because it is compatible \nwith the command line. Eclipse _is_ using the :ext: protocol. It doesn\u0027t matter that it\u0027s an internal or \nexternal SSH program.",
    "The ext connetion method must remain an external connection since it can be \nused with connection clients other than SSH (e.g. RSH). Did you do what I \nsuggested and configure the ext connection method to use extssh on the \nTeam\u003eCVS\u003eExt Connection method preference page? Doing this will give you the \nexact same behavior you are requesting (i.e. you will use ext as your \nconnection method and connections in Eclipse will use the Eclipse SSH2 client).\n",
    "Ok. I get it now. :-) I had misunderstood your instructions the first time around. I have now changed \nthe External Connection method to use :extssh: as it\u0027s protocol, and we\u0027re good -- it works great. \nThanks again -- as usual, you show me that it\u0027s human error and Eclipse can, in fact, do exactly what I \nwant. :-)"
