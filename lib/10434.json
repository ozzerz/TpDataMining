    "Eclipse 20020214-S and 20020226-I\nWindows 2000 and Linux motif RedHat 7.2\n\nThis bug makes it nearly impossible for me to check and submit any code \ndeveloped by our new hire.\n\n1) load SWT from the cvs repository.\n2) Copy .classpath_win32 to .classpath and build SWT\n3) In the packages view, select \"Compare with... Patch\" from the custom menu.\n4) Select the patch file I have attached.\n5) The dialog appears and everything looks good.  Hit next and all the tree \nitems are check off.  So far so good.\n6) Click on the finish button.\n\nNothing happens.  An error is silently sent to .log and the compare editor \nnever appears.\n\n\nLog: Wed Feb 27 16:02:27 EST 2002\n4 org.eclipse.compare 1 !JavaPlugin.internal_error!\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: \nResource /org.eclipse.swt/org/eclipse/swt/widgets does not exist.\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkExists\n(Resource.java(Compiled Code))\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkAccessible\n(Resource.java(Compiled Code))\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.File.create(File.java(Compiled \nCode))\n\tat org.eclipse.compare.internal.patch.Patcher.store(Patcher.java:894)\n\tat org.eclipse.compare.internal.patch.Patcher.applyAll(Patcher.java:787)\n\tat org.eclipse.compare.internal.patch.PatchWizard$1.run\n(PatchWizard.java:123)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run\n(ModalContext.java:98)\n\t4 org.eclipse.core.resources 368 \nResource /org.eclipse.swt/org/eclipse/swt/widgets does not exist.",

    "I haven\u0027t seen any action on this bug report and it seriously impedes our \nability to submit code changes from our coop and newhire.  Is there any chance \nit will be fixed soon?  Right now we can not use the patch tool at all and have \nto send entire files to each other - I would prefer to help test this feature.",
    "fixed for M5.\n\nVeronika,\nyou mentioned in your comment\n\u0027...all the tree items are check off.  So far so good....\u0027\n\nActually, if all the tree items are checked off that is not so good :-)\n\nHere is what you should do:\n\nthe overall goal is to get a minimal number of red errors (and a \ncorresponding maximal number of checked checkboxes) by adjusting\nthe following options:\n\n - try the ignore whitespace option first since most of our old files in the\n   repository were checked in as binary, our patch files (generated by CVS)\n   have illegal line separators (a PR exists)\n   (If you open one of these patch files in our editors you\u0027ll see\n   lots of empty lines. These lines typically don\u0027t match what you\n   have in your workspace. Be careful, other editors cannot deal with\n   these illegal line separators and the patch file looks fine).\n\n - if the ignore whitespace option does not reduce the number of errors\n   try to increase the \u0027fuzz\u0027 factor (patch terminology). Normally if patch\n   cannot find a match at a given line number it tries to apply the patch\n   in the range starting 2 lines before and ending 2 lines after the line.\n   However, if the file has been changed in a way that the original lines\n   have moved more than 2 lines you have to increase the size of this range\n   by adjusting the fuzz factor.\n\n - if this doesn\u0027t help\n   may be the patch has been generated in a directory whose name doesn\u0027t\n   match the directory name in your workpace. Try the \u0027ignore leading path\n   name segments\u0027 to strip off one or more the leading directory names.\n\n - if this doesn\u0027t help either\n   then may be the patch is a reversed patch. Click the \u0027Reverse patch\u0027 option.\n\nIf you cannot get rid of all the errors either backout from applying the patch \n(and send me the patch file if you think there\u0027s an error in the patch \nfunctionality) or apply the patch anyway. For every non-match a .rej is created,\nand you have to deal with them manually. This is normal patch semantic.\n\nHope this clarifies \u0027patch\u0027 somewhat..\n"
