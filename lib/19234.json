    "Build 20020602 (F2)\n\nSorry, no steps.  I was writing code for a couple of hours, and I noticed this \nstack in my log afterwards.  I was using the java browsing perspective to write \ncode.  Hopefully the stack trace contains enough information to be useful...\n\nAttaching complete log file, but here\u0027s the top of the stack:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.correction.NewMethodCompletionProposal.apply(Ne\nwMethodCompletionProposal.java:253)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d1244)\nLog file showing stack traces\n",
    "Sorry, attached wrong log.  Please ignore that one.  Will attach correct one...",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d1245)\nLog file showing stack trace\n",
    "see also 19253 \n\neither we didn\u0027t notice up to now or there is a change of behaviour somewhere \nthat triggers all kinds of not present exceptions",
    "we should guard against the NPE",
    "fixed \u003e 20020607\nreviewed by EG",
    "Not able to verify since there isn\u0027t a repeatable test case. Code got reviewed.\n\nClosing..."
