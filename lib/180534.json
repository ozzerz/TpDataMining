    "Opening defect against Platform.UI.Example.testsuite and Platform.Samples.LoggingExamples.testsuite per my discussion with Liz.  These test cases might have been missed during refactoring.  Here\u0027s the exception I get for both of them:\n\nThere was an error while running the macro associated with the test case: CreateNavigatorExtSample.  org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: A time-out occurred while running command MacroCommand [select, line 3].  This is likely caused by the presence of an unexpected dialog or the absence of an expected dialog.\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.test.auto.gui.internal.commands.MacroCommandShell.playback(MacroCommandShell.java:1093)\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.test.auto.gui.internal.macro.Macro.playback(Macro.java:346)\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.test.auto.gui.internal.macro.MacroManager.runMacro(MacroManager.java:574)\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.test.auto.gui.internal.macro.MacroManager.access$4(MacroManager.java:568)\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.test.auto.gui.internal.macro.MacroManager$1$MacroOperationWrapper.run(MacroManager.java:501)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:797)",
    "Targeting to 4.4i2 as this is part of the i2 test pass.",
    "The Test Project will absorb this refactoring work this one time only based on Liz\u0027s commitment to complete the work.\n\nMoving forward, test case maintenance is the responsibility of the owner of the component under test.  Of course, Liz and myself are always available for answering AGR-specific questions.",
    "Sizing based on Liz\u0027s recommendation.",
    "I have refactored these test cases and checked in the results (as well as the execution histories). Please note that in some examples you are required to select \u0027Finish\u0027 twice, causing a playback problem which can be easily solved manually. I will open a defect for this.",
    "Reporter: Please verify and close in preparation for shutting down the TPTP 4.4 release.  Thanks.",
    "Verified on TPTP-4.4.0-200706140100C",
    "Closing."
