    "Double click on an ecore file that is inside a jar and you receive this \nexception in the Ecore editor:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException: \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.JarEntryEditorInput\n\tat org.eclipse.emf.ecore.presentation.EcoreEditor.createModel\n(EcoreEditor.java:821)\n\tat org.eclipse.emf.ecore.presentation.EcoreEditor.createPages\n(EcoreEditor.java:845)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.part.MultiPageEditorPart.createPartControl\n(MultiPageEditorPart.java:241)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditorReference.createPartHelper\n(EditorReference.java:585)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditorReference.createPart\n(EditorReference.java:365)\n\nThis Editor should at least allow you to view the ecore, even if it is \nuneditable.",
    "Karen,\n\nThis is a feature request.  You are asking us to support other forms of\nIEditorInput that we aren\u0027t expecting to see and have never supported. A similar\ntype of problem happens when opening from a CVS view:\n\nUnable to create this part due to an internal error. Reason for the failure:\norg/eclipse/team/internal/ccvs/ui/RemoteFileEditorInput incompatible with\norg/eclipse/ui/IFileEditorInput\n\nI definitely agree that it would be very nice to support at least read only\nviews on these things.  It would be especially nice if our generated editors\nsupport that too, so we might as well try to address that more general issue\nwhile we are at it.\n\nHow can I reproduce this particular problem you report?\n\nOne problematic aspect we\u0027ll need to solve is that we really need a well formed\nURI to represent the input so that relative URIs within the document can be\nproperly resolved.",
    "Ed, you\u0027re right, this is a feature request, though possibly the editor could \nhandle the situation better instead of showing an internal error(though it\u0027s \nrather self-explanatory).\n\nI hit this problem while trying to view the Ecore.ecore.  I have the \norg.eclipse.emf.ecore_2.1.0.jar as a Plugin-Dependency in my plug-in and \nbrowsed to the Ecore.ecore inside of that jar.  So instead of viewing it from \ninside of the jar I had to add the emf plugin as an External Plug-in.  \nDefinitely a minor issue",

    "Karen,\n\nThis will be harder to support than I might like.  The only way I can get the\ninformation I need to open the resource properly is using toString on the\nIStorage of the IStorageEditorInput to yield something like this:\n\nJarEntryFile[D:\\sandbox\\unpackage1_I20050823\\eclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.emf.ecore\\ecore.jar::stuff/library.ecore]\n\nFrom that I could synthesize this URL to open the resource\n\n  archive:/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.ecore/ecore.jar!/stuff/library.ecore\n\nI noticed that things like the plugin.xml editor don\u0027t work in this case, but\nI\u0027m not sure what disabled the editor so it doesn\u0027t try to come up and fail...\n\nAlthough things like IStorage have a method that returns an InputStream, without\na URI, we won\u0027t be able to resolve any of the relative cross resource references\nwithin the file, so having just a stream is not sufficient.\n\nThe CVS thing is even worse.  I know I can determine something like this from\nthe IStorage\u0027s path:\n\ndev.eclipse.org/cvsroot/tools/org.eclipse.emf/plugins/org.eclipse.emf.ecore/model/Ecore.ecore\n1.1\n\nBut I don\u0027t know how to turn that into a URL that accesses the resource.",
    "I committed change that provided limited support for this.  Cross document references won\u0027t resolve...",
    "Fixed in the I200512151150 build.",
    "Sorry, my commit failed because of CVS problems this morning, so this won\u0027t be in a build until next week."
