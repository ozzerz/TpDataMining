    "See the last 4 sub-entries in the log section below. The use of subentries to\nseparate the sentences of a message seems awkward. Is it to show easily readable\nmessages in the log view? Or is it because long messages are not properly\nwrapped when written to the log file? If it is the latter, this would be a case\nfor a bug/enhacement request against Platform/Core. The former does not look\nlike a sound reason, since it makes reading the log file directly much harder\n(and it looks like a misuse of status objects).\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.core 4 -6 Apr 11, 2004 04:08:17.449\n!MESSAGE CVS Workspace\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.core 4 0 Apr 11, 2004 04:08:17.481\n!MESSAGE An error occurred refreshing /org.eclipse.core.tests.runtime: I/O has b\neen interrupted.\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSCommunicationException[0]: jav\na.io.InterruptedIOException: Timeout while reading from input stream\n        at org.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.PollingInputStream.read(Pollin\ngInputStream.java:123)\n...
