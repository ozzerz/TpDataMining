    "Whenever I run a plugin that has been created using the HelloWorld template\nusing the run-time Workbench, I get the following error:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.isAlreadyRunning(Main.java:1443)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:577)\n\nNo source is attached to org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main in the standard.\n\nConfiguration:\nMac OS X 10.2.8\nEclipse 3.0M7\n\nGerd",
    "sounds like you are using an old vm.  You need 1.4.1 vm or higher for 3.0.\nIs this the case here?",
    "This is what I suspect, too, but...\n\ngerd% java -version\njava version \"1.4.1_01\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.1_01-69.1)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.1_01-24, mixed mode)",
    "Andre, what are the exact requirements for Mac?",
    "Just for documentation:\n\n1.4.1_01 is, to my knowledge, the newest Java available for Jaguar 10.2.8.\nI don\u0027t think there will ever be a newer Java for Jaguar.\n\nThere is a newer Java version 1.4.2 which requires Panther 10.3.x",
    "1.4.1 for Jaguar is fine.\nHowever, in the near future (before we ship 3.0) we\u0027ll require Panther.\n\nBut I\u0027ll try to reproduce the problem...",
    "Hmm, we had this error running with 1.3 VMs (see bug 47233). Any chance of\nanother VM being accidently picked up? Although we require 1.4, we don\u0027t prevent\nrunning with a 1.3 VM (it just fails in some VM dependant way). Bug 44814\naddresses that.",
    "Hmmm, I was unable to reproduce the problem.\nHere is what I did:\n- Installed Jaguar (10.2.7) on an external disk.\n- via Software Update upgraded to 10.2.8 and installed all OS patches and Java updates\n- downloaded Eclipse 3.0 M7 to my Desktop (Stuffit Expander unpacked it automatically)\n- double clicked Eclipse.app (to launch it with fresh workspace)\n- opened New wizard and in category \"Plug-in Development\" created new Plug-in Project\n- on next page named it \"Hello\"\n- pressed \"Next\" three times\n- on Template page checked \"Create a plug-in...\"\n- selected \"Hello World\"\n- pressed \"Finish\"\n- Answered \"no\" to question whether to switch to PDE perspective\n- manually switched to Java perspective\n- selected Hello project\n- from toolbar drop down item \"Run Run-time workbench\" selected Run As ... \u003e Run-time Workbench\n\nNew Eclipse launched. From \"Sample Menu\" selected \"Sample Action\".\nEverything seems to work fine (at least for me).\n\nSo here\u0027s the question: does it work for you if you follow exactly my steps from above? ",
    "Andre,\n\nI have no 10.2.7 to install (started Jaguar with 10.2.0) so I reproduced your\ntest with \n- downloaded Eclipse 3.0 M7 to my Desktop (Stuffit Expander unpacked it\nautomatically)\n\n-\u003e it works. \nThanks and sorry. \n\nSeems I have a corrupted workspace. Everything else works.\nWish myself fun to fix this :-)\n\nGerd"
