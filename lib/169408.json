I have the web root of my documents separate from where my workspace is... the files are deployed to the web root, so I have a separate copy.\n\nXDebug is a great feature, I have been using it for a week, and absolutely love it, much better than Zend Debugger.\n\nAnyway I have created a temporary path mapper myself, as not being able to have breakpoints where I want was really a show stopper (only break at first line worked). Its not perfect code, but it works (I wasn\u0027t going to spend ages on it, just wanted the breakpoints to work).\n\nSo if anybody has the same problem, feel free to use my fix (until this is implemented by the original author).\n\nInstall \u0026 Configure\n1. Download the attachement\n2. Remove 2 original xdebug files in plugins directory.\n3. Copy the files from the archive into your eclipse directory\n4. Start eclipse\n5. Go to Help/Software Updates/Manage Configuration\n6. Enable XDebug Feature\n7. Restart Eclipse\n8. Go to Window/Preferences. Find the new configuration page under PHP/Xdebug Rewrite\n9. There you can configure your path maps.\n\nExample:\nyour workspace file is in\nd:\\workspaces\\myproject\\somefile.php\n\nyour web root file is in\ne:\\wwwroot\\webapp\\somefile.php\n\nso the paths you have to configure are:\nRewrite From:\nd:/workspaces/myproject/\n\nRewrite To:\ne:/wwwroot/webapp/\n\nnote that the slashes have to be in linux style.\n\nThats it, if you have any questions, post here. I will attach the source code as well, if you want to play around or fix something. This is not something I will be supporting, just a quick fix :)\n\nThis only works with PDT RC2 and Java 1.5 (generics huh)...\n\nHope this might someone...\n\n\nThanks to the D Kelsey for great work!!!",

    "Hi again everyone,  I finally got around to installing XDebug and a new version of  PDT (0.7.0.v20070221) in order to test remote web page debugging with a windows xp client machine and a linux machine running apache2, php 4.4.0 and samba.\n\nI report some success, in that when \"break on first line\" is enable i can step through the code and I can see variables and even switch stack frames which is great (I was unable to do this with phpdbg and phpeclise).\n\nHowever, the problem is that xdebug (and also the zend debugger) are both not stopping at any breakpoints.\n\nA source file on the linux box is created as:\n\n/home/dominicc/web/grt2/htdocs/index.php\n\nThe linux server runs samba, /home/dominicc is shared as \"dominicc\" and is mapped to P: on my windows box, so i access the above file in eclipse as:\n\nP:\\web\\grt2\\htdocs\\index.php\n\nThe web pages are served by an apache vhost that has a documentroot of /home/dominicc/web.  it\u0027s url is http://dev01.grt.local/~dominicc, so naturally i point my web browser at the following url to run the script.\n\nhttp://dev01.grt.local/~dominicc/grt2/htdocs/index.php\n\nMy eclipse project\u0027s root is\n\nP:\\web\\grt2\n\nI added an XDebug rewrite as follows:\n\nrewrite from: /home/dominicc/web/grt2/\nrewrite to: P:/web/grt2/\n\nI also tried without trailing and leading slashes (yes, without leading slashes, see below)\n\nWhen I start a debug session with \u0027break at first line\u0027 enbaled I see the source code open (which actually isn\u0027t the index.php above but actually is an auto-prepended file as defined in an .htaccess file in the same folder as the index.php file, which is good as this indicates at least some source code lookup is working).  Interestingly however if I remove the xdebug rewrite and restart the debugger it still manages to find my auto-prepended file (\"/home/dominicc/web/grt2/lib/grt_prepend.inc\") and stops at the first line of code in it.\n\nThe file names displayed in the debug view have their leading / removed.  so they appear like this (after stepping through the prepended file).\n\nhome/dominicc/web/grt2/htdocs/shop.php.include : lineno 41\nhome/dominicc/web/grt2/htdocs/index.php.{main} : lineno 3\n\nI also note that each time i go into the properties for the \"PHP Web Script with XDebug\" for my debug configuration the Server URL resets to: \"http://localhost\" which is an additional problem that needs fixing.\n\nthe other xdebug settings are as follows:\n\nscript and server: \"/grt2/htdocs/index.php\"\n\nserver url: \"http://dev01.grt.local/~dominicc\ncontext root: \"grt2\" \u003c-- what is this anyway?\nthe url that is generated is: \"http://dev01.grt.local/~dominicc/grt2/htdocs/index.php\" which is correct.\n\nI enabled the \"override project/workspace \u0027break at first line\u0027 setting\" and also \"break at first line\".  Disabling them had no effect on the problem with ignoring breakpoints.\n\nCan someone tell me if any of my settings are incorrect (and what correct settings should be)?\n\nIf they are all correct then can someone please investigate this issue?\n\nIf you require screenshots of my configuration or further information please ask.\n\nKeep up the good work so far!\n",
    "Hi,\n\nI just been speaking to Mark, who was trying to use Path Mapper to no success.\n\nWe did sort it out in the end, and it was the case sensitivity.\n\nI should have warned straight away about this, but in any case:\n- Rewrite rules and paths are case sensetive, even if you use windows.\n- \"C:\\myproject\" is not the same as \"c:\\myproject\"\n- By default on windows large letter is used for drives, so if something isn\u0027t working, try changing the letter of the driver to a capital\n- Directories are case sensitive as well\n- Case sensitivity is required to make it compatible with Linux\n\n\nThanks to Mark for helping me to identify and post about this issue.\n\n\nP.S. I am currently working on a new version of the path mapper which uses a proper encoding as suggested by G Palmer. I wasn\u0027t aware of the GeneralUtils.encodeFileName function, so I kind of hacked my way through the encoding, which is why iot might not have played nice with spaces in directories etc.\n\nNow I have a working version, however I am going on a holiday tomorrow, so I don\u0027t know if I will have enough time to package it and post it tonight. If not I will post the update in 2 weeks, when I am back.\n\nIn any case I do plan on supporting this extension in the future. Dave kindly offered to add an extension hook to his code, so it would make it easier for me to maintain the actual path mapper.\n\nI am also removing generics so it works with java \u003c 1.5 and also adding a debugging console, so you can actually see whats happening and see why the rules might not be working.\n\nThis will be in the next update.

I noticed a while ago when i used phpdbg that on one of our servers the I\nsaw paths like this: \"/home/dominicc/web/\" but when apache served the pages it\ngave a path of \"/export/home/dominicc/web/\" (it\u0027s real path) to the debugger\ndue to the way the filesystem on the server had been configured.

    "\u003e (In reply to comment #37)\n\nThe reason I changed it was because I was getting garbage for string values because of the Base64 decoding. If you think about it, resources always need to get encoded if they\u0027re transported through xml, strings not, so the code as it is makes more sense.\nIt seems some people are also getting strings encoded in base64.  So I went and read what the dbgp protocol says: http://xdebug.org/docs-dbgp.php#properties-variables-and-values\nIt turns out the property xml definition includes whether the value is encoded or not, so what needs to be done is instead of deciding whether to decode a value or not based on the data-type, use the \"encode\" attribute.\n\nI\u0027ll try to provide a fix, but I don\u0027t have time right now...\nBTW, it might make sense to move the source code to some repository :)\n\n-a.",
    "XDebug doesn\u0027t encode resource names by default. The format it provides is\nresource(%ld) of type (%s)\nif however CDATA tags are present then it will encode it. What type of resource are you using that requires base64 decoding ? I have resources that don\u0027t require base 64 decoding.\n\nI will be including in the next release, testing for the encoding property so that it determines it from the xml data passed rather than just blind assumption.\n\nAs for a repository, this is a submission to the eclipse PDT project and the eclipse CVS will be the repository for this code if the contribution is accepted.\n",
    "This Bugzilla entry is getting quite large now. \n\nCan I suggest that discussions on XDebug support be done on the PDT eclipse forum. As the disccusions here are more applicable to a forum based environment and it would also give more exposure of xdebug support to the PDT community as a whole.\n\nMany thanks",
    "(In reply to comment #40)\nI\u0027m all for moving discussion to PDT. What would be the forum URL?\nAs for the encoding, that seems to be a bug, so I\u0027m reporting it here. The problem is not with the names, but with the values. Not all CDATA must be decoded, it depends on whether in the xml the \"encoded\" attribute value is \"base64\". Resources (binary data) values should always come encoded, but others like Strings it seems it actually depends on the server: I don\u0027t get them encoded, but other people are reporting they do.\nLet me know if you have further questions. Thanks!\n\nAndres.",
    "Strings are always encoded base64. Resources will only be encoded in base64 under certain circumstances.\n\nI have changed the code to support the encoded attribute, and this plus other fixes will be made available some time after PDT version 0.7 is officially released as I will need to update the code to accomodate changes to APIs and behaviour for this release.\n\nEclipse has a forum server, and I am sure the PDT home page will have a link to their particular forum on that server, sorry can\u0027t remember it off hand.\n\n\n\n",
    "Hi Dan,\nI found out that if there are multiple files with the same name and you put a breakpoint on that file, when the breakpoint is reached Eclipse doesn\u0027t necessarily open the correct file, but the first one it finds on that project with the given name.\nSo for example, I have these files\nProject/add/index.php\nProject/test/index.php\nAnd I put a breakpoint in Project/test/index.php, when the breakpoint is reached, Eclipse shows the source code of \"Project/add\u0027index.php\"\nI am using Maxim\u0027s path rewriter.\nIs this a known issue? Will it be fixed in the next release? If not any suggestions what might be causing this and where should I start looking to fix it?
