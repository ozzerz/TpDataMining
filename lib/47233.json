    "Eclipse 200311201600\nOS X 10.3.1\n\nWhen running the runtime workbench, I get the following error in the console:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.isAlreadyRunning(Main.java:1504)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:597)\n\nthere are no logs present.\n\nChanning",
    "Move to Platform/Core.",
    "Which VM are you running on? Eclipse 3.0 requires a 1.4 VM to run.\n\nThe failure happens because the launcher uses 1.4 specific API, and it seems to\nnot be available in your setup. \n\nWe need to be able to run at least the launcher on a 1.2/1.3 VM and produce a\nclear message describing the problem. This is being handled in bug 44814.\n\n",
    "Ah, eclipse is running under 1.4 but I lauched the workbench under 1.3.\nSwitching made it work correctly.\n\nSorry about that.\n\nPerhaps the Run time workbench launcher should warn that the VM being used is\nnot compatible?",
    "Agreed. The PR mentioned above takes care of that. Closing...\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 44814 ***",
    "Thanks Rafael"
