    "When devloping SWT using a JRE that doesn\u0027t support AWT, the AWTStarter is\nputting errors into the .log file.  It\u0027d be nice to catch the AWTError that\u0027s\nthrown if the AWT toolkit is not found or can\u0027t be initialized (see the\ngetDefaultToolkit()\u0027s javadoc).  Or even better would be to avoid calling the\nAWTStarter when not launching a JFC remote vm.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.jem.proxy 2 0 2005-05-21 12:40:31.938\n!MESSAGE \n+++ Warning +++: Sat May 21 12:40:31 EDT 2005    Project (KaffeTest)-VM for\nKaffeTest:err\u003e\n    Exception in thread \"Thread-2\" java.awt.AWTError: Cannot load AWT toolkit: \n       at java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit() (/usr/local/lib/libgcj.so.6.0.0)\n       at org.eclipse.jem.internal.proxy.vm.remote.AWTStarter$1.run() (Unknown\nSource)\n       at .GC_start_routine (/usr/local/lib/libgcj.so.6.0.0)\n       at .__clone (/lib/libc-2.3.4.so)\n    Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: \n       at java.lang.Class.forName(java.lang.String, boolean,\njava.lang.ClassLoader) (/usr/local/lib/libgcj.so.6.0.0)\n       at java.lang.Class.forName(java.lang.String) (/usr/local/lib/libgcj.so.6.0.0)\n       at java.awt.Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit() (/usr/local/lib/libgcj.so.6.0.0)\n       ...3 more",
    "Could you please append the complete stack trace? I don\u0027t know where we are\ncalling the getToolkit so I can\u0027t narrow down why. Thanks.",
    "That\u0027s the full stack trace I\u0027m getting.  I found the getDefaultToolkit() call\nin question in AWTStarter - line 30.\n\nIt looks like this may be preventing the beaninfo cache from being generated. \nThe VE comes up fine if you have the beaninfo cache left over from the Sun VM...\nbut if you do a clean, the cache does not get regenerated, but no other errors\nare logged.  The editor comes up without any settings made to the UI and the\nproperty sheet blank.",
    "Hmmm... disregard that last comment. There was a delay before the cache was\nflushed and showed up on the disk.  But it\u0027s still a puzzle as to why it comes\nup properly with the Sun beaninfo, but is broken with the GCJ beaninfo.  I\u0027ll do\na diff of their respective caches to look for clues.",
    "I don\u0027t think the call to AWTStarter is the problem. We could squash the trace.\nIt would be nice if we knew there was no AWT but I don\u0027t know how to do that\nquickly. If we knew in some easy way we could also not show the awt/swing\npalette too.\n\nBut it can\u0027t be the AWTStarter that is causing the problem. As you stated, it\nmust be something else. Beside this trace what are the symptoms of the problem\nother than the call to AWTStarter.\n\nBy the way, the cache is delayed five minutes before being written or written at\nshutdown or project close.",
    "No new info, so closing for now.",
