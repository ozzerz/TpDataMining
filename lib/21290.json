    "1) Select Menu - [Window]-[Show view]-[Other]\n2) Select [SWT Examples]-[OLE Web Browser (Win32)]\n3) load the following HTML\n\n\n\u003cOBJECT classid\u003d\"clsid:8AD9C840-044E-11D1-B3E9-00805F499D93\" \nWIDTH \u003d 500 HEIGHT \u003d 500  \ncodebase\u003d\"http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/1.1.2/jinstall-112-\nwin32.cab#Version\u003d1,1,2,0\"\u003e",
    "The HTML is using java plugin provided SUN microsystems, \nand it is popular for Applet user (see the following web site).\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/docs/guide/plugin/developer_guide/using_tags.html\n\nIf this happens only on example, I don\u0027t think this is critical.\nBut other implementations for web browser using MSIE do same behavior.\nSo I think base (OLE support?) has problem or can have work-around.\n",
    "VI to investigate.\n",
    "I don\u0027t understand how this PR can be marked \"major\", given that the only \nevidence of the problem is that a particular example is failing.\n\nI also am having trouble understanding the sentence \"But other implementations \nfor web browser using MSIE do same behavior.\". Are you saying that, other Java \napplications which embed the IE ActiveX control do not crash when loading this \nexample?\n\n",
    "I said other implementations of embeded IE based on SWT OLE also \ncrash with the example HTML.\n\nActually, IBM WSAD 4.0 which is based on R1.0 crashes when \nthe example html is opened by \"Open with...\"-\u003e\"Web Browser\".\nIt must be same situation for R2.0-based \"Web Browser\".",
    "The workbench does not hang for me.\n\nI created a file with the html provided and tried to open it with IE.\nIE just sits there with the status bar showing \"APPLET tag missing CODE \nparameter.\"  In IE, the cursor stays busy but you are able to select toolbar \nitems such as forward and back.  \n\nThe same thing happens with the SWT Example Web Browser.\nIn addition, the following is displayed in the console:\n\nAPPLET tag missing CODE parameter.\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: C:\\Program Files\\Java Plug-in 1.1\\classes\n\tat java.io.FileInputStream.\u003cinit\u003e(FileInputStream.java:56)\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.getSystemResourceAsStream(ClassLoader.java:364)\n\tat sun.applet.AppletClassLoader.getResourceAsStream\n(AppletClassLoader.java:597)\n\tat sun.applet.AppletPanel.createApplet(AppletPanel.java:466)\n\tat sun.applet.AppletPanel.runLoader(AppletPanel.java:395)\n\tat sun.applet.AppletPanel.run(Compiled Code)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:466)\n",
    "If I do not have the Java Plugin installed for IE.  I get a dialog prompting me \nto install the plugin.  This happens in both IE and SWT Example Web Browser.  \nOnce plugin is installed you get the same behaviour described in my previous \npost.  Install dialog is not modal and does not \"hang\" Eclipse.",
    "Works for me in Eclipse 2.0.1 on Windows 2000 and Windows XP.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d1941)\nFile to hang workbench up\n",
    "Sorry to late for my reply.\nI checked again with the latest workbench and still hang up.\nI attached a html file. Please try it.\nI tried both on windows2000 and XP.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d1942)\nOne more file to check\n",
    "This doesn\u0027t happen on PC which has Java Plugin.",
    "I ran your latest attachment in Internet Explorer.  IE hangs and  the status \nline says \"exception: null\". If IE hangs, I would be surprised if an ActiveX \ncontainer for IE would behave any differently.  The problem appears to be in \nyour applet."
