    "eclipse 3.2 and TPTP 4.2.0\nRunning TPTP JUnit Plugin test.\nCreated the testsuite file, workbench location file, and the deployment correctly.\n\nWhen I run test remotely, the test progress bar first stays at 60% for about a minute and then suddenly closes without any message or warning. I checked the .metadata/.log file to find this exeption. \n\norg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.launch(TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.java:420)\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.launchTestExecution(TestExecutionHarness.java:2085)\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.access$3(TestExecutionHarness.java:1817)\n        at org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$2.run(TestExecutionHarness.java:741)\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\n\nEarlier I got this problem when runnning the tests on my local machine (using a stand-alone agent controller). I stopped the workbench and the agent controller and deleted /tmp/IBMRAC/ramaster file. After this the problem was solved.\n\nBut for remote test on a different machine:-\n- I tried clearing up the /tmp/IBMRAC/ramaster file on both machines.\n- Installed TPTP on the remote workbench\n\nAlso, the agent controller has been configured properly with correct PATH, JAVA_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH set. I can even connect to the agent. The agent spawns a java process(mentioned with details below) and deploys a workspace at /tmp/\u003cuser\u003e\n\nThe java process that runs on the remote machine is:-\n\u003cjava_bin_path\u003e/java -Dhyades.test.JVM\u003d\"\u003cjava_bin_path\u003e/java\" org.eclipse.hyades.execution.remote.NodeImpl 9803543",
    "Prince,\nDo you have the log produced the remote eclipse instance? It is either in the remote configuration directory (should be something like /tmp/\u003cuser\u003e/tptp-configuration-xxx/ if you kept the defaults) if eclipse failed early, or in your workspace metadata directory(something like /tmp/\u003cuser\u003e/tptp-workspace-xxx/.metadata/).\nIf you have it, can you attach it to this bugzilla or send it to me by email. Thanks.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d47065)\nlog from the remote eclipse\u0027s /tmp/\u003cuser\u003e/tptp-configuration-\u003cpluginname\u003e/\n\nHi Julien,\n\nI\u0027m attaching the required log file.\n\nPrince Singh\nDrishti Soft Solutions",
    "Thanks,\nIt looks like TPTP is not correctly recognized on your remote eclipse. The test fails because eclipse can\u0027t find the plugin \"org.eclipse.hyades.test.tools.core\". This is either because this plugin is not installed, or one of its pre-requisites is missing (for instance, EMF).\nAnother explanation could be that you installed TPTP after having launched eclipse once. In this case you need to run the remote eclipse with the -clean option on the command line, so eclipse may rescan the plugins directory, and find TPTP plugins.\n\nThe better way to fix the problem is to make sure that TPTP is working on the remote eclipse first, launched in standalone mode. Can you launch the remote eclipse instance, and check that TPTP plugins are available? (One simple verification is to see if the \"Test\" category is available in the \"New...\" wizard). If TPTP is not available, could you 1) check that all pre-requisistes are installed (EMF) and 2) try launching eclipse with -clean on the command line.\nIf TPTP is working on the remote eclipse launched standalone, and you still have problems with launching remote tests, then let me know.",
    "Hi Julien,\n\nI had already seen the log and thought that to be the problem. To confirm I tried to run the TPTP junit plugin test on the remote machine from its eclispe workbech only. Standalone Agent controller also at the machine. I could do it successfully. No errors or failures or log output.\n\nTPTP is also installed correctly:-\n1. I\u0027ve Test category in New \u003e Other\n2. I can see the \"org.eclipse.hyades.test.tools.core\" in About \u003e Plugins\n3. I can see the \"org.eclipse.hyades.test.tools.core\" in Plugins-Registry(Show View \u003e PDE Runtime)\n\nI\u0027ve also run eclipse using \u0027eclipse -clean\u0027\nIf you require more input then I can provide\n\nPrince Singh\nDrishti Soft Solutions\n\nPrince Singh\nDrishti Soft Solutions\n\n",
    "Thanks Prince,\nI have been delayed by some testing tasks on the 4.2.1 candidate build, but now I\u0027m trying to reproduce the problem. Can you tell me:\n1) On which platform the local eclipse (as opposed to remote) is running?\n2) Are the local eclipse\u0027s target plaform (the one defined in Preferences \u003e Plug-in Development \u003e Target Platform \u003e Location) and the remote eclipse identical (i.e. same plugins, same versions)?",
    "Hi Julien,\n\n(In reply to comment #5)\n\u003e Thanks Prince,\n\u003e I have been delayed by some testing tasks on the 4.2.1 candidate build, but now\n\nNo problem !\n\n\u003e I\u0027m trying to reproduce the problem. Can you tell me:\n\u003e 1) On which platform the local eclipse (as opposed to remote) is running?\n\nLinux on both local as well as remote. \n\n\u003e 2) Are the local eclipse\u0027s target plaform (the one defined in Preferences \u003e\n\u003e Plug-in Development \u003e Target Platform \u003e Location) and the remote eclipse\n\u003e identical (i.e. same plugins, same versions)?\n\nNow that may be the problem. On the remote platform I do not have all the plugins that are enabled on the Target Platform page of the local eclipse. Though I have all the required plugins for my plugin on the remote platform(I can run the test locally there). What could be the possible way to select only the plugins required by my plugin from the Target Platform sheet.\n\nAlso, the Location text box on the local eclipse is not the same as the remote one.\n\u003e \n\n",

In the current version, TPTP does not check that the remote platform has all the plugins available. The list of plugins to activate can be edited in the workbench location editor (in the \"Eclipse Workbench Properties\" tab \u003e \"Choose plug-ins to launch from the list\").\nYou need to uncheck in this list all the plug-ins that are not installed on your remote eclipse. Also, you need to make sure that the versions of the plug-ins shown in this list match the versions of the plug-ins on the remote machine (the versions need to be *completely* identical).\n\u003e \n\u003e Also, the Location text box on the local eclipse is not the same as the remote\n\u003e one.\nIf you mean the \"Eclipse location\" text box, this field must contain the path of the eclipse directory on the remote machine.",
