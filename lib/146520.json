    "The problem occurs when creating groups in a table in 2.1RC4 (Designer All-In-One Install).\n\nMy aim was to display in a table \"products\u0027 name by products\u0027 line\" from the \nClassicModels sample DB.\n\nThe error I get is :\n\n\u003e report report:\n\u003e - Nom de colonne de cl? de groupe incorrect : _{$TEMP_GROUP_0$}_\n\u003e data.engine.InvalidGroupKeyName ( 1 time(s) )\n\u003e d?tails : org.eclipse.birt.data.engine.core.DataException: Nom de colonne de \n\u003e cl? de groupe incorrect : _{$TEMP_GROUP_0$}_ at \n\u003e \u003eorg.eclipse.birt.data.engine.executor.transform.group.GroupCalculationUtil.initGroupSpec(GroupCalculationUtil.java:255)\n\u003e ...\n\n\nThis can be reproduced by :\n1- inserting a table (2 cols, 1 detail) in the report\n2- dragging Customers.ProductLine in the first column\n3- dragging Customers.ProductName in the second one\n4- making a group on Customers.ProductLine (no interval as it is a string)\n\nI must add that this issue DOES NOT HAPPEN again after I restart Eclipse.\nI hope you will be able to reproduce this behaviour since it doesn\u0027t happen every time I create a table with groups.\n\nThanks.\n\nR?gis Lanson",

If anyone wouldn\u0027t upgrade Birt2.1.3 until it\u0027s officially released, I can provide a patch on this problem in 2.1.2. If needed, please let me know.\n\nThanks\nMingxia"
