    "I want to create a line chart or area chart that has a linear x axis and a linear y axis.  When I try to create this type of chart I get the following exception:\n\nCaused by: org.eclipse.birt.chart.exception.ChartException: Lines may not be rendered on a value scale \n       at org.eclipse.birt.chart.render.Line.renderSeries(Line.java:135) \n\nI am not sure why these types of charts are not allowed since they are used widely in many business domains.",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d35121)\narea mockup\n\n",
    "I suggest cancelling this bug.\nArea/Line chart can\u0027t use a linear axis as X axis, since we can\u0027t render the line or  polygon with two groups of continuous data, but the point. Users can use a scatter chart instead.",
    "Agree to cancel. Scatter charts already provide the needed functionality."
