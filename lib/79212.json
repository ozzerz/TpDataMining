    "Thanks.\nThe apache server works best on linux (even though it is multiplatform, the \nwindows version is probably not as good iis).\nThe error from Tomcat maybe something that happened, but the server recovered.\nYou may want to post some question or check the archives at the apache\u0027s \njakarta project to get more info on tomcat errors.\n\nThere may be a hidden bug in update, or in the jre itself (some network \nstreams not properly closed, etc.), but it is hard to pinpoint what\u0027s \nhappening. I tried updating the entire eclipse from my local apache http \nserver and I had no problems. At some point, I was also copying another very \nlarge file into the same DocumentRoot folder for the apache http server, in \nwhich case the whole local network download became very slow. This is no \nrelated to what you do, but just fyi.",
    "Ok, thanks. I have write Summary of the problem below.

    "On issue 2: if feasible, use the os and server (linux/apache) that works, or \ncauses the fewest problems\n\nIssue 1: it isn\u0027t clear whether the problem still occurs when using \nlinux/apache",
    "Dorian,\n\n   the issue no.1 occurred in all tested cases, unfortunately - i.e. \nApache/Linux as well as Tomcat/Windows. Client for all cases: WindowsXP \n\nNews about issue no.1: it seems there is problem with too many connections - \nremove of one of handles pointing to \\Device\\Tcp \u003d\u003e ping and other connections \nto local network started to work.\n  \nI\u0027m not familiar with windows socket I can\u0027t tell you information about that in \ndetail. \n\nit seems to me there is a problem with the concept: a download connection per \nplugin (does it mean: 138 plugins \u003d\u003e 138 connections ?). my question: is there \nany possibility to disable that ? (\u003d\u003e only one connection for all.) If it is \nnot, then: is there any chance to change it simply in context of source code ? \n",
    "All these connections should be happening in a serial fashion. I wonder if \nanything is left open, the so the network layer does not release those \nconnection. I will investigate this.",

    "Thanks for the extra info, that should help.\nYou may also play with the http server, they usually have settings for the \nnumber of connections allowed.\nSome download code in update is done via threads, but only to be able to \ncancel, in which case the connection dies by itself. I may need to revisit \nthat code to see if it can cause your problems.\nI would also recommend trying various jdk\u0027s, to see if things improve.",
    "I did it, I played with the params like no. of connections - no effect. Then I \nhad changed param KeepAlive On -\u003e Off and result was: 1/ the connections in \nstate ESTABLISHED erlier was in state CLOSE_WAIT then (represents waiting for a \nconnection termination request from the local user) but stay there till \napplication close 2/ the error occurred later than in case of the previous set-\nup.\n\nI\u0027m worry about long ongoing in state FIN_WAIT_2 you can see in previous log as \nwell.\n\nSo, it seems to me there is realy hard-core problem at low network level about \nconnection finnalization.\n\nI\u0027m going to send other log.\n",

    "Hi\n\nI noticed the same bug after installing Eclipse 3.1. Eclipse 3.0 went fine, but\nnow with Eclipse 3.1 when I want to install new features through the update\nmanager, my complete network connection hangs after a certain time. That means\nthat my pc can\u0027t connect to anything in the web or the local lan.\n\nThe difference to the problem of the bug reporter is, that it happens when im\nupdating official features like EMF from the official update site.
