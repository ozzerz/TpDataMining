    "In an effort to get the Core tools working again, Jeff kindly volunteered to\nhead up this task. Work will be done in stages:\n\n1). Fix-up \n  - make the current core tools work against the current 3.0 code base. \n  - set our plugin.xml to be \u003c?eclipse\u003d3.0. \n  - migrate old extensions to newly named UI points, etc.\n\n2). RCP \n  - make sure that we can be run in the RCP world. \n  - split up the tools so we don\u0027t rely on runtime.compatibility. \n  - separate runtime/runtime registry/resources?\n\n3). New work \n  - Geoff\u0027s marker spy\n  - new OSGi bundle spies\n  - add new views, etc\n\nGoal is to have #1 and #2 done in the next 2 weeks.",

    "From https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d47518 ...\n\nMinor nits: Shouldn\u0027t include the word \"Perspective\" to perspective names, or\n\"View\" to view names. There is inconsistent use of both \"plugin\" and \"plug-in\"\nin the UI as well.\n\nAnother UI anomaly: There are several columns related to memory usage \nthat \"hide\" behind the \u0027Order\u0027 column.  No scroll bars are shown to indicate \ntheir presence.  You must start with J9 to have content in them.  It\u0027s my \nguess that these columns are sized to zero. These columns should have some \nminimum size, or if considered optional, an explicit means of hiding/showing \nthem.\n",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d10128)\npreference viewer\n\nHere\u0027s a preference viewer for the new eclipse preferences. Its basic...just\nshows the tree. Some parts are slow since it agressively loads all nodes at\neach level. Should probably add a \"collapse all\" button too.",
    "Preferences viewer looks cool.  I never knew there was so much stuffed in \npreferences.  :-o  I\u0027m not sure what the empty nodes mean -- defaults are \nset?  Will this be explained in the online docs?\n\nBTW, is the dependency on the compatibility plug-in necessary?",
    "Empty nodes means that someone asked for it. (they are lazily initialized) The\nreason that the default has a child (mostly empty) for each bundle in the system\nwas a design decision. Since they are not persisted to disk, what are the\nchildren of the \"/default\" node? I decided that they should be the bundles which\nare installed on the system since any bundle can customize their preferences. \n\nWith the \"/instance\" it was more straight forward...just see who has prefs\nstored on disk.\n\nThe compatibility layer thing was just an artifact of the way I created the\nplug-in. I\u0027ve removed it and it still works ok.\n",
