    "I think this is really important for M6.",
    "I haven\u0027t been able to reproduce this.  Martin, does it happen when you try?",
    "I also cannot reproduce this with I20070405-0600. I only found bug 181197 along the way (correctly transferred but \"Empty List\" displayed).\n\nBurak - I cannot quite understand your instructions. What did you mean by \"Paste to Desktop\"? Pasting to Windows Explorer or Windows Desktop does not work for me. Could you re-try with I20070405-0600 or be more specific?\n\nDave - does the traceback tell you anything?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d63036)\nSteps to reproduce (Capture)\n\nPlease see attached capture of what I do. It is 100% reproducible on my environment.",
    "Burak: Thanks for the screen capture. I tried very hard but I still cannot reproduce it. I tried doing exactly as you, SSH -\u003e Local. With an empty directory, or one with exactly one file. Browsing into the folder or not -- I just cannot reproduce it.\n\nDid you make the screen capture with I20070405-0600?\n\nI really have no idea what\u0027s going on here. Could it be that in your desktop, a file with this name (but different uppercase/lowercase) already exists? Could it be that the remote file is actually stale because you deleted it outside RSE? Any more hints are helpful.\n\nI\u0027m decreasing severity to NORMAL since it looks like you\u0027re the only one who hits this.",
    "Burak - this is probably fixed by the fix for bug 181197 (avoid refresh event for file transfer when create event already sent).\n\nCould you re-test with the I20070405-1810 build?\n\nThanks!",
    "I tried it with the latest and it still exists on my environment.\n\nHowever, I have another vm windows machine for some testing purposes and I tried it on that machine and as you said, there is no problem at all.\n\nShould I reinstall my computer? :)\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ll try to find the possible reasons for this when I have time. ",
    "It must be something about my workspace. Any other workspace I use or new created works just fine.",
    "Perhaps this is related to bug 181553 and you still have some stale deleted files in the cache. Dave - any other ideas?",
    "My guess is there\u0027s a problem in the temp files cache.  It would be an interesting experiment to backup the RemoteSystemTempFiles project and then clear the cache to confirm whether it\u0027s related to the cache.",
    "Burak can you ZIP up the RemoteSystemsTempFiles project, delete its contents (keeping the directory and the .project file intact!) and then retry?",
    "I have tried but no change. \n\nI think, it is about something in my .metadata directory which is 1.5GB for now :) ",
    "Are you able to edit the files that you\u0027re trying to copy?  If not, then the problem is likely to do with the download.",
    "I haven\u0027t heard any response to this for a while.  Is this still a problem?",
    "I have not seen the problem for a while. You\u0027d better close it if it is not reproducible.\n\nRegards,\nBurak",
    "marking this as worksfor me since no has been able to reproduce it recently."
