    "When I\u0027ve changed a file on my local machine and want to see the diffents to \nthe latest version in the repository (CVS), I\u0027ve tried to use the \"Synchronize \nwith repository...\" entry in the context menu. This results in an empty file \nfrom the repository compared with the local changed.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d702)\nSynchronize output\n",
    "Did you find any error information about this in the .log file?\nWas it reproducable?\nCould you successfully compare other files with the repository?\nDid you check whether that version of the file is empty in the repository?\n",
    "No, there are no more comments or information in the \".log\" file. This behavior \noccures with _every_ file I tried to compare from the CVS (the updating and \ncommiting of files succeeds, also the synchronization itself). The local \ncomparement succeeds too, but not the one between local and CVS files and \ndifferent versions from CVS files (in the second case both views are empty).",
    "Kevin, do you know anything about this problem?\n",
    "Never heard.\n\nIts possible a warning message is being issued from the CVS server.  We only \nreport errors directly to the user -- the other messages (of which there are \nmany) go to the CVS Console view.  Reporter should open the CVS Console view \nand try the operation to see if anything is printed there.  Maybe they don\u0027t \nhave read rights?",
    "awaiting info from reporter",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d767)\nLog file containg one error\n",
    "No, there are no more messages in the CVS output window. The only thing I can \nsee is the attached log file but the message seems to handle an error in the \ndebugger...",
    "Moving to debug.  Top of stack reads:\n\n \u003cstatus\n     code\u003d\"120\"\n     severity\u003d\"ERROR\"\n     message\u003d\"Error logged from Debug UI: \"\n     plugin-id\u003d\"org.eclipse.debug.ui\"\u003e\n    \u003cexception\n       message\u003d\"Document root element is missing.\"\n       trace\u003d\"\norg.xml.sax.SAXParseException: Document root element is missing.\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.fatal(Parser2.java:3182)\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.fatal(Parser2.java:3170)\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.parseInternal(Parser2.java:501)\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.parse(Parser2.java:305)\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.XMLReaderImpl.parse(XMLReaderImpl.java:442)\n\tat org.apache.crimson.jaxp.DocumentBuilderImpl.parse\n(DocumentBuilderImpl.java:185)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin.restoreLaunchHistory\n(DebugUIPlugin.java:1227)\n",
    "The \u0027Document root element is missing\u0027 problem was fixed some time ago (I can\u0027t find the original \nPR).  It was related to mixed-mode launching (launchers \u0026 launch configurations).  ",
    "Please verify.",
    "The exception seems not to be responsible for the strange behavior! The general \nproblem is still the none existing file on client side I think. If the CVS \ndidn\u0027t return the requested file to be compared, the compare component cannot \nfind the differences. Where is the difference between the \"Update\" from CVS to \nthe \"Give me version xx\"?",
    "Does this only occur if you sync directly on the file on when you sync on an \nancestor as well? Also, what build are you running?",
    "This happens even when I used the Sychronize on the File but also when I used \nthe command on a parent tree node. I\u0027m currently working with build 20020416.",
    "Could you try a later build and see if the problem is still there. I seem to \nrecall that we did have a couple problem back then that may have caused this \n(one involved file \u003e 32K).",
    "CVS is on a (somewhat older Redhat 6.1) Linux:\nConcurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.10.7 (client/server)\n\nI once had a report on Option \"-C\" not supported (by CVS)\n\nThe Command:\n  ReplaceWith/Latest From Repository\n\ndoes not work, too. (This should delete the current file and replace\nit by the top-level revision from CVS)\n\n\n\n\n",
    "That explains it. We only support CVS version 1.11.1 and beyond.",
    "To clerify the above comment, older versions work when using pure cvs commands \n(such as Checkout from the repo view and Team/Update and Commit) but more \nadvanced features may not work properly because of their dependence on new \nfeatures (such as the -C flag on update).",
    "Closing assuming problem was combination of debug (fixed) and server version.\nIf persists on 1.11.1p1 or 1.11.2, please reopen."
