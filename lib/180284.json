    "With attachment 62215, if I tried to create a dynamic Web project choosing the Axis2 facet without first installing the Axis2 runtime location using the preference, I got the message:\n\nFailed while installing Axis2 Web Services Core 1.1.\n\nThe Axis2 facet install should present the user with a configuration page to enter the Axis2 runtime location (best to reuse the Axis2 runtime preference page).  After they enter the Axis2 runtime location in the Axis2 facet install configuration page, it would be use for the current project and also stored in the Axis2 runtime preference.  This is similar to when creating dynamic Web project, if the runtime has not been created, the user is directed to the preference page to install the server runtime.  From that point on, the installed server runtime would be used.",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d65365)\nfix for the Bug 180284\n\nIssue -\u003e Axis2: Failed to install Axis2 facet when Axis2 runtime location not set\n\nNow the error was thrown to the user from the Framwrowk indicating the user \nthat there was an error in Axis2 Facet installation and he needs to include Axis2 Preferences. \nAs \n\nFailed while installing Axis2 Web Services Core 1.1.\n  Axis2 runtime is not set at web services preferences page!! Please set the web services runtime by navigating through preferences.\n  /home/sandakith/Desktop/axis2-1.2-RC/webapp (No such file or directory)\n\n\n* Also with this path, I have fixed some related issues/improvements that I came through when resolving the above issue, they are...\n\n1) All paths persist (correct/incorrect) in the preferences, include restart eclipse also\n2) error will display to the user when wrong paths are persist in the \npreferences and user then user tries to create DWP including axis2 facet\n3) Now the creating facet with alternatively pointing to the webapp location and binary location is also possible. \n\nwith this fix user will not have any scenario of blank. I have tested all scenarios with the latest integration build 20070426.\n\nThanks \n\nLahiru\n\n",
