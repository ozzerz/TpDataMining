    "Here\u0027s an update:\n1) The problem only rears its head when using a workspace outside the eclipse\ninstall (whether specified through a \"-data *workspacepath*\" or the workspace\nchooser).  It doesn\u0027t happen when the workspace is ..\\eclipse\\workspace\n\n2) It still happens in RC2 ",
    "There is no org.eclipse.ui.workbench application. It has been replaced by\norg.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench. It seems you are using an old launch configuration\nthat was created at the time org.eclipse.ui.workbench was the Workbench\u0027s\napplication id. Just go to your launch configuration and ensure the right\napplication id is selected there.\n\nIs that what is happening with you?",
    "Nope, the application running is org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench in the\nconfiguration.  Everything in the configuration are just defaults.  I\u0027m running\ninto the problem from a fresh install.\n\nI think that this bug should be really easy to replicate. Just:\n1) Start with a fresh installation of M9, RC1 or RC2\n2) On startup choose a workspace outside of the installation path (Eclipse in\nC:\\eclipse and the workspace in C:\\sandbox)\n3) Go to the workbench and open the PDE perspective\n4) File \u003e New \u003e Plug-in Project\n5) Enter any name for the project (\"foo\")\n6) Accept all other defaults (Next, Finish)\n7) On the overview page that opens, click Launch a Runtime Workbench\n\nThe runtime workbench fails with the option to view the log posted previously.\n\nAre you able to replicate this behavior?  These are the only steps necessary\nthat I\u0027ve run into.",
    "No, I am not. Running with an workspace outside the Eclipse install is the\nrecommended setup, so I would be surprised if that caused any problems.\n\nI believe there must be some problem with the Runtime Workbench launch\nconfiguration you have in the c:\\sandbox workspace. Please try the following:\n\n1 - In the Java or Plugin perspectives, open the launch configuration management\ndialog (Run -\u003e Run...)\n2 - select the \"Run-time Workbench\" category, *not* the launch configuration\nnamed \"Run-time Workbench\"\n3 - Press \"New\"\n4 - Run the just created launch configuration (named New_Configuration...) by\npressing Run.\n\nDoes it work?",
    "No, the new configuration (\"New Configuration (1)\") produces exactly the same\nresults.\n\nI\u0027m really suprised that you weren\u0027t able to replicate the behavior.  I\u0027ve\ntested the procedure several times with M9, RC1 and RC2.  Did you start with a\nfresh install and a new workspace?",
    "Just did that again using RC1. Everything works fine. There seems to be\nsomething wrong with your install. The message referring to a\n\"org.eclipse.ui.workbench\" application is very suspicious.\n\nDo you have any plugins/features installed other than the ones in the Eclipse\nSDK? How did you \"install\" RC1? Extracted it to an empty directory, or on top of\nan existing install (that is not supported)?\n\n",
    "I\u0027m extracting it into an empty directory.\n\nThis is getting increasingly subtle.  I installed eclipse on a Win2k Pro box and\neverthing was fine.\n\nOn my computer, I rename the directory containing the old install of eclipse and\nextract a new one.  (Rename C:\\dev\\eclipse to C:\\dev\\eclipse_old and extract the\nnew install to C:\\dev)\n\nIt looks like eclipse must be reading my other workspaces.  They are all in\nC:\\sandbox.\n\nIf I use a workspace called C:\\temp\\absolutelynewworkspace everything is fine.\nIf I use a workspace called C:\\sandbox\\absolutelynewworkspace I have problems.\nIf I move all my old legacy workspaces in C:\\sandbox to C:\\sandbox\\old and use a\nworkspace called C:\\sandbox\\absolutelynewworkspace everything is fine.\nThen, if I move all my old workspaces back from C:\\sandbox\\old to C:\\sandbox and\ndelete C:\\sandbox\\absolutelynewworkspace, then startup using a workspace called\nC:\\sandbox\\absolutelynewworkspace, everything is broken again.\n\nI sanity checked that it doesn\u0027t have anything to do with a legacy\nruntime-workspace.\n\nThis is definitely a bug, but to my mind is rapidly dropping in priority.  At\nleast I\u0027m confident that users of my plug-in are *very* unlikely to run into the\nsame problem.\n\nWhat do you think?\n",
    "Found it\n\nlooks like I had a year-old copy of the \"features\" directory from the 2.0 / 2.1\ndays in my C:\\sandbox folder at the same level as the workspace and eclipse only\nrecently started trying to load it.\n\nI don\u0027t know that eclipse should try to load features from this directory.  It\nmight also be trying to load plugins if there was a \"plugins\" directory, but I\nhaven\u0027t tried it.\n\nI\u0027ll leave the status of this bug to your discretion.  Thanks *so* much for your\ntime and attention Rafael! :)",
    "That usually happens if your launch configuration has the \"Use features in the\nworkspace (simulated normal startup)\" option, in the plugins tab. Since that is\nnot the default, you should not have that option set. Can you confirm that you\nare *not* using that option?\n",
    "It is not checked\n\nTo my knowledge, this would only load a feature (org.eclipse.platform-feature)\nif it was in the workspace\n(C:\\sandbox\\absolutelynewworkspace\\org.eclipse.platform-feature).\n\nIt appears that the runtime workbench is loading it from\nC:\\sandbox\\features\\org.eclipse.platform-feature which is not in the workspace\n(C:\\sandbox\\absolutelynewworkspace).",
    "Nope,\n\nI moved the feature to the Win2k box and cannot replicate the problem.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d12081)\nfeatures directory for test case to replicate problem\n\nextract in the same directory as the workspace NOT within the workspace\ndirectory",
    "whoops,\n\nI was able to replicate the problem.  I hadn\u0027t copied over the contents of the\ndirectory due to permission problems.  See the attached features directory above.",
    "I could not reproduce... what I did (with RC1):\n\n- extracted the contents of attachment 12081 to d:\\sandbox (preserving paths, so\nthe platform feature will be at d:\\sandbox\\features\\org.eclipse.platform-feature)\n- started Eclipse selecting d:\\sandbox\\workspace as my dev workspace\n- created a new plugin\n- started a runtime workbench using the link available off the Overview page (a\ntarget workspace is created at d:\\sandbox\\runtime-workbench-workspace)\n\nResult: Eclipse comes up without any problems. Did I miss any step?",
    "That should have done it.  Maybe try restarting eclipse?",
    "Nope... can you reproduce it with the same steps I executed? Would be better if\nyou used another location (other than \"sandbox\"), add the feature there, and\ntried to reproduce it with 3.0 RC1 freshly installed\n(\u003ceclipse_home\u003e/configuration has only a config.ini file, no subdirs, no\n3rd-party plug-ins/features). Thanks.",
    "A new workspace would be cool, too. Whatever base location you choose, it should\nbe empty before you start to put things there.",
    "It worked for me.  I used RC2, since that was easier to find.  I\u0027ll track down\nRC1 and give it another go after I fire this off.\n\nCreated C:\\temp\\eclipsebug directory\nExtracted eclipse RC2 and features.zip into the directory\ncreated directory workspace so that the contents of C:\\temp\\eclipsebug is\n-eclipse\n-features\n-workspace\n\nFired up eclipse by double clicking on it.  Go to workspace.  Window \u003e Open\nPerspective \u003e Other \u003e PDE Perspective.  File \u003e New \u003e Plugin Project.  Enter\n\"foo\" as the name, Next, Finish.  Click on the link on the overview page to\nstart a new runtime-workbench.\n\nruntime-workbench fails\n\nI\u0027ll give RC1 a try and give an update.",
    "In my last post, when I said it worked that was a misnomer.  RC2 failed.  I\ntried RC1 and it did not fail.  I tried another install of RC2 using the above\nprocedure in another directory and it failed again.  Can you try RC2?",
    "I finally could reproduce. Thanks for the information. \n\nIt seems that PDE is adding the workspace\u0027s parent directory to the list of\nsites in the generated platform.xml. Is that intended? I guess it does not make\nsense when the launch configuration is *not* using the \"simulated startup\" style.\n\nMoving to PDE.",
    "Great! Thanks again for your help.",
