    "I added a classpath variable. I clicked OK on the dialog suggesting a full \nrebuild. After a while I clicked \"run in background\" on the ensuing progress \ndialog. I was preented with a \"User Operation is Waiting\" dialog with two \ntasks listed. One was \"Setting variables\" -- the workspace rebuild. The other \nwas \"Java - JAXBTest.java - Eclipse Platform\". This file happended to be the \n(only) open file in the editor pane. The build completed, but the second task \nstayed around. Clicking on its red \"Stop\" button had no effect. So at this \npoint Eclipse is sitting there doing nothing (the javaw task shows no CPU \nactivity) with a modal dialog open over it that cannot be closed. My only \nrecourse is to kill eclipse from the OS.",
    "It gets worse...\n\nNow when I launch eclipse the \"User Operation is Waiting\" is displayed right \nfrom the start with a workspace rebuild and the same weird taks (see in \nprevious post) displayed. The workspace build is done ... twice. Then the \nmodal dialog just sits there. So now my workspace is completely unusable. \nGreat. Just what I needed ... start a new workspace, configure and import \neverything ...  and I can\u0027t even look at the settings in the old workspace.",
    "What build of Eclipse are you using? Where there any errors in the log file? ",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d11171)\nContains .log extract.\n\nThis was M9. I\u0027m attaching the tail of the log file. Note that some of the \n!SESSIONS are from M8, but now that the build id is inserted these can be\nidentified. \n\nSince then the following has happend:\n- I switched back to M8 to make the workspace rebuild. Then back again to M9.\nThe same thing happend.\n- I tried backing up the configuration directory in M9 by renaming it. On\nrestart of M9 the configuration directory was duly recreated. The dialog did\nnot come up again. However, while Eclipse was superficically functional\n(selections could be made,etc), it was maxing out the CPU. Any attempt ro\nreally do something (e.g., menu selection) would not be honored (menu would\nstay dropped down and nothing would happen). \n- I gave up on M9 and went back to M8. Did a minor ammount of work using M8. On\nseeing your post, I wanted to see if anything was logged, so went back to M9\nagain. Now everything seems normal.\n\nI\u0027ll try to use M9 to see if the orignal problem remanifest, meanwhile perhaps\nyou can learn something from the log fragment.",
    "The modal dialog that never closes is covered by bug 64745.\n\nMany of the errors in the log come from third party plugins, but there are\nseveral NPEs coming from PDE classpath container initialization. This would\nalmost certainly causes builds to be broken, as you describe.
