    "Tested GLA Junit testing with TPTP-4.2.0-200602281515 on AS400. It works fine. I have caught the same error as bug 130033 before. It normally happened when I started a second Junit execution after I killed the Junit execution process which hung at 54%. I would restart the eclipse and this error will disappear.",
    "Re-opening since this defect has since sporadically reappeared in the TPTP-4.2.0-200602281515 driver when launching remote TPTP JUnit tests on 390 (zSeries). \n\nLinux (zSeries) and OS400 (iSeries) appear to be consistently stable.\n",
    "Mark, please investigate.  Thanks",
    "I tried several times to execute JUnit tests from a Windows workbench using a z/OS RAC and was successful each time.   \n\nI am reassigning this to Scott since he is currently responsible for Test Execution Harness and JUnit Runner. ",
    "I\u0027ll attach an Agent Controller servicelog.log that shows the remote test execution on our z/OS machine.  The only error that looks suspicious is:\n\nConsole connect to ip\u003d91abef0 port\u003d4000 failed. Major error\u003d53. Platform specific error\u003d 1127 EDC8127I Connection timed out.\n\nThis occurs when trying to launch the HyadesTestingSession application.  However, it appears the application was launched successfully and the RemoteSession agent registered with Agent Controller.\n\nI believe the problem needs to be debugged on the client side",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d35788)\nz/OS Agent Controller log for the error scenario\n\n",
    "Paul,\n\nIs it true that this is a sporadic problem.  If so, can we please reduce the severity to maor, as we have other more critical issues than this oen to triage in i2.\n\nThanks,\n--Joe",
    "I will work with Dwayne to debug this issue once the higher priority defects have been resolved",
    "*** Bug 135644 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "(In reply to comment #9)\n\nYes.  Sure.\n",
    "Since this failure is inconsistent and is not on the i2 must fix list, the defect is being deferred to i3.",
    "Mark Dunn indicated that this defect is no longer an issue, so I am transferring the defect back to him for closure.",
    "Reassign back to DuWayne.  Sorry for the confusion.  This is not the defect I thought it was (when I asked you to transfer it to me).  Although URL Tests run OK on z/os (for me), I have not tried as/400 . ",
    "I did the TPTP Junit tests on Linux390 and AS400 platform in 4.2 i2Test pass. This kind of error didn\u0027t happen during the tests.",
    "Per Cindy\u0027s comments and weekly defect review meeting conversation today, closing this one out.",
    "Closing."
