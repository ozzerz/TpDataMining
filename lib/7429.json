    "Build: 2001-12-19\n\nI have a workspace with a java perspective and a debug perspective (all in one \nworkbench window).  The java perspective had two java editors open on shutdown.  \nOn startup, there was an error creating the editors (red error message appears \nin editor area, \"An error has occurred when creating this editor\".  I will \nattach the log, but here is the relevant snippet:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException at \norg.eclipse.ui.part.PageBookView$SelectionProvider.getSelection(PageBookView.jav\na:199)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d209)\nLog file showing NPE on startup.\n",
    "I have not been able to reproduce it.  I recall nothing out of the ordinary \nabout what I was doing yesterday before shutdown.",
    "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 7117 ***"
