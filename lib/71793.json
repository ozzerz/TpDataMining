    "This code...\n\npublic aspect Test {\n\t\n\tint field;\n\t\n\tpublic Test() {\n\t\tfield \u003d 0;\n\t}\n\n..some pieces of advice...\n\n}\n\n...leads to this exception:\n\norg.aspectj.lang.NoAspectBoundException: Exception while initializing aha_Test: \norg.aspectj.lang.NoAspectBoundException: aha_Test\n\tat aha.Test.aspectOf(Test.aj)\n\tat aha.Aha.main(Aha.java)\nCaused by: org.aspectj.lang.NoAspectBoundException: aha_Test\n\tat aha.Test.aspectOf(Test.aj)\n\tat aha.Test.\u003cinit\u003e(Test.aj:21)\n\tat aha.Test.ajc$postClinit(Test.aj)\n\tat aha.Test.\u003cclinit\u003e(Test.aj:16)\n\t... 1 more\nException in thread \"main\" \n\n\nI assume that something weird happens when I set field in initialization phase!?",
    "whether or not this is a bug depends on exactly what the \"some pieces of advice\" \nare. If you are trying to advise a join point that happens before the aspect is \nconstructed (like any field set in the aspect perhaps?) then the behaviour you \nare seeing is correct. Please confirm or supply a complete test case that \nreproduces the bug...\n\nThanks, A.",
    "Yes, I am having a set-advice on that field. That makes sense, cheers.\nHowever, I would wish to have a better error message in that case if possible. \n(e.g. output, what advice causes this error)",
    "I\u0027m moving this to an enhancement request. The exception you see occurs at \nruntime (obviously) and gives pretty good information already: whilst \ninitializing the \"aha_Test\" aspect (\"aha.Test\" would have been better there), an \nattempt was made to obtain the aha.Test aspect instance, and a \nNoAspectBoundException was thrown\".\n\nThe enhancement to be considered is that is some cases we know statically that \nthis problem is going to occur - i.e. when weaving advice into an aspect \ninitializer, and that advice has no runtime test associated with it. In such \ncircumstances we could put out a compilation error. Your program would be one \nsuch situation I suspect.",
    "We\u0027re not going to get to this in AJ 1.5.0. Marking as \"LATER\" for consideration\nin 1.5.1 and future release planning."
