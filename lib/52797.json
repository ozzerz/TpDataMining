    "Using the code currently in the tree (taking it as pre-1.2), compile  \nexamples/bean/files.lst:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.LazyMethodGen.getSignature(LazyMethodGen.java:1225)\n\tat org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelClassWeaver$1.compare(BcelClassWeaver.java:676)\n\tat java.util.Arrays.mergeSort(Arrays.java:1176)\n\tat java.util.Arrays.sort(Arrays.java:1123)\n\n(I would have thought this would have been caught in a nightly \"release\" build,\nwhich compiles all the examples.)",
    "Hmm, I would have expected the cruise control tests to pick that up too... will \nhave to investigate. Assigning to George Harley initially to figure out why the\ntest failure was not picked up. Also marking as target 1.2 as we need to resolve \nthis before any release.\n\nGeorge, please reassign to Andy or I once you\u0027ve looked at the cruise control \nportion.",
    "As a fix for defect 50096 I have added a couple of custom Ant tasks to our \nnightly build scripts that will fail the build if (a) a failure is detected in \nthe running of the JUnit tests or (b) a failure is detected in the running of \nthe other harness tests. These tasks were only introduced to our build machine \ntoday (23 Feb) and I would expect them to catch this sort of error.",
    "The actual bug here appears to be the same as bug #51919 to do with cases \nwhere multiple methods are ITD\u0027d that have the same name but differ in terms \nof parameter signatures.  Looking at BoundPoint in the bean example, it \ncontains ITDs that have exactly this characteristic.\n\n51919 is now fixed and with the latest version of AspectJ from CVS, I can \ncompile with examples/bean/files.lst.",
    "fixed by both Andy Clement and George Harley.",
    "updating target flag to indicate inclusion in 1.2 release."
