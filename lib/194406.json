    "Found this one in the logs. It seems like it is coming from the LocalTask.SYNC_DATE_NOW, though that one is not supposed to be passed to jira connector.\n\n-- Error Log --\nDate: Tue Jun 26 02:19:54 EDT 2007\nMessage: Error while parsing date string now\nSeverity: Info\nPlugin ID: org.eclipse.mylyn\nStack Trace:\njava.text.ParseException: Unparseable date: \"now\"\nat java.text.DateFormat.parse(DateFormat.java:337)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.ui.JiraRepositoryConnector.convertDate(JiraRepositoryConnector.java:250)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.jira.ui.JiraRepositoryConnector.markStaleTasks(JiraRepositoryConnector.java:177)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.SynchronizeQueryJob.run(SynchronizeQueryJob.java:101)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)",
    "Rob, why don\u0027t LocalTask return null for last sync timestamp? Also how is could happend that LocalTask been passed to jira connector?",
    "This is caused by a patch that was merged as part of bug 192309 to allow marking tasks as read that do not have task data. That is a bad side effect to we may need to revert that change.  Rob, does it make sense to store the read flag separately?",
    " (In reply to comment #2)\n\u003e Rob, does it make sense to store the read flag\n\u003e separately?\nYes, this may be our best option, I\u0027ll have to look at the implications.....",
    "I think our best bet for now might be to set the set the time stamp to the respective TaskRepository.getSynchronizationTimeStamp() if the task data is missing and it is not a local task. Thoughts?",
    "Further to conference call... I\u0027d like to avoid a second field for \u0027read\u0027 since the date stamp is the center of the read/unread state and messing with this at this point could cause further problems. I\u0027m leaning towards using the repository time stamp and adding a FAQ entry to address the situation where marking read isn\u0027t working. ",
    "Unfortunately this won\u0027t work for web tasks....",
    "Fixed. \u0027Hits\u0027 are decorated as such when they have a) have incoming state and b) their last synch is null. Upon marking read, state moves to synchronized but date remains null.  The task is no longer marked as a hit user expectations are met.  Upon opening the task, the state is updated (a timestamp is set using newly retrieved data). Steffen, if you get a chance, please do a sanity check, specifically wrt WebTasks. I\u0027ll bootstrap and look for hickups. \n\nOld tasks with \u0027now\u0027 timestamp will need to be deleted.",
