    "After you have invoked and used Eclipse for a while from a directory (say \nc:\\eclipse), try renaming the directory (to say c:\\eclipse.bak).  Eclipse will \nno longer come up and you will be stuck with a welcome screen.",
    "The log shows a ClassCastException.",
    "The failure mode is bad.  Unclear if it is because the name changed or because \nit is not Elcipse (for example what if the original was c:\\foo\\eclipse and then \nit was renamed to c:\\bar\\eclipse).\n\nBTW, the presence of \"eclipse\" as the install dir is API.  I am not advocating \nthat we rely on it in the runtime but it is in the doc that eclipse is expected \nto be installed in a dir called \"eclipse\"",
    "I found a related problem however it does not have the same error than what I\nsaw, since I get an exception saying that the application is not found.\n\nTo reproduce, take M8 install it, run it (without the -data option).\nQuit, rename the install folder to something else, restart.\nThe following error is logged:\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to locate application extension:\norg.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run(PlatformActivator.java:263)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:239)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:117)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\n\tat\nsun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:324)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:267)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:692)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:676)\n\n\nAfter a short debug session (we don\u0027t go far anyway :-)), it seems that is is\nthe update configurator that does not detect changes.",
    "When the parent directory is renamed, the update configurator does not detect \nany change (it looks at timestamps only).\nAs such, eclipse runs out of its cached bundles, but the cached bundles may \nhave hard coded location values, so things fail. The failure is actually in \nthe framework, as the update configurarator successfully starts.\n\nI changed config.ini to add osgi.checkConfiguration\u003dtrue and that triggered \nthe update configurator and the platform runtime to ignore the cached bundles \nand recompute what\u0027s needed. Everything worked fine.\n(Jeff, how do you pass -Dosgi.checkConfiguration to eclipse without modifying \nconfig.ini? I was not able to do it that way).\n\nFor Jeff/Pascal: what should the expected behavior be when eclipse is \nmoved/renamed? Should we keep track of the original install location and \ncompare with what is current running?",
    "Fixed in the latest integration build (0514).\nThe configurator is now checking/saving the framework timestamp as well. This \ntimestamp changes when eclipse is renamed, so the configurator reinstalls the \nbundles."
