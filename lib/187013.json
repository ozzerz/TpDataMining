    "Export of Web 2.5 project fails with error: \n\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.internal.web.archive.operations.WebComponentLoadStrategyImpl.addLooseLibJARsToFiles(WebComponentLoadStrategyImpl.java:63)\n\tat org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.internal.web.archive.operations.WebComponentLoadStrategyImpl.getFiles(WebComponentLoadStrategyImpl.java:43)\n\t\nThis is problem is caused again by the ArtifactEdit issue. I log this bug to track the activies on resolving it.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d67248)\nexample patch (not working)\n\nThe attached patch is not working. It only illustrates how the problem described in the bug would be solved. \n\nThe issue with the patch is that the import references in the WebComponentExportDataModelProvider.getDefaultOperation() cannot be resolved due to cyclic dependencies between org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.web and org.eclipse.jst.jee.web plugins. Even if they are solvable we still experiences switches (that we want to get rid of) to check if we have J2EE or Java EE 5 model. \n\nGood approach to solve the issue is to modify the IModelProvider interface by adding new method - getExportOperation(). This way the corresponding implementation of the IModelProvider will return the appropriate export operation class. \n\nEven better approach will be to have more generic method IModelProvider.getOperation(operationType). \n\nAlternative approach would be to have separate OperationProviderManager that will exist in parallel with the ModelProviderManager. It will return similar IOperationProvider interface. \n\nAny of the above approaches requires changes in the API, but will solve our issues with overriding operations for the Java EE 5 scenarios. Use cases are all import/export operation, add sevlet operation, etc. \n\nDoes it make sense and is it feasable for WTP 2.0?",
    "We are working on import and export now... Jason might already have a bug open for that (making this a duplicate).",
    "Well, the web 2.5 export works OK with RC0. I suggest this is due to the fact that WebArtifactEdit does not return null for Web 2.5 projects any more. \n\nYou can close this bug if this is the desired solution.  ",
    "I verified - this works fine on RC2",
    "Yes, I have also verified it with the S-2.0RC2-200706050057 build.",
    "Closing as verified."
