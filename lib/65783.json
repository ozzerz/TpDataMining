    "I200406040800\n- Am working on a creating a testcase for testing the addition of a dynamic \nplugin.  When the test runs, I get the following in my .log file (even though \nthe test succeeds):\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 0 Jun 04, 2004 14:34:50.789\n!MESSAGE Error notifying registry change listener.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 0 Jun 04, 2004 14:34:50.789\n!MESSAGE \n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.registry.FlushableExtension.getConfigurationElements\n(FlushableExtension.java:22)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.ui.internal.registry.PerspectiveRegistry.buildNewCacheObject\n(PerspectiveRegistry.java:524)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.registry.RegistryManager.add\n(RegistryManager.java:121)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.registry.RegistryManager.registryChanged\n(RegistryManager.java:102)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.registry.ExtensionRegistry$ExtensionEventDispatcherJo\nb.run(ExtensionRegistry.java:56)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66)\n\nWe don\u0027t have this test in the CVS repository right now.  Please come and see \nme if you need help reproducing this problem.",
    "Can we fix this for RC2? #getRegistry can return null but there are several\nplaces that don\u0027t handle this...",
    "Debbie, were you by any chance dynamically removing the plugin right after\nadding it? That would explain why the extension does now about its registry anymore.",
    "Never tried to remove the plug-in, but the test will likely shutdown soon \nafter the check.",
    "Investigated the problem with Debbie. This was both a problem with the test case\nitself and with the utility class Debbie was using to install plugins (provided\nby us), causing it to fail when running with an existing configuration.\n\nWe should add a test case for when a bundle is installed, resolved and then\nre-resolved. This should cause the registry objects to be removed, and new ones\nto be re-created (generating two events, a REMOVED and a ADDED, on this order).\nDuring our investigation I am pretty sure we saw a situation where only a\nREMOVED event was issued (at least this is what the registry debug listener showed).",
    "This can be done later (it is a test issue).",
    "UI is fine with this as the test utility to install plugins has been changed \nso we no longer see this NPE.",
    "Added test case to runtime tests.",
    "I have this strange habit of marking bugs targetting RC* as M*..."
