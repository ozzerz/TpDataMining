    "This must be a duplicate of another report I filled while back, but I can\u0027t find it now. This happens when I tried to open Jira editor for some issue. \nIt disappear after I opened repository properties and kicked verify.\n\n-- Error Log --\nDate: Thu Nov 09 18:04:58 PST 2006\nMessage: Could not download report\nSeverity: Error\nPlugin ID: org.eclipse.mylar.core\nStack Trace:\norg.tigris.jira.core.service.exceptions.AuthenticationException\nat org.tigris.jira.internal.core.service.soap.SoapJiraService.getProjects(SoapJiraService.java:190)\nat org.tigris.jira.core.service.CachedRpcJiraServer.initializeProjects(CachedRpcJiraServer.java:192)\nat org.tigris.jira.core.service.CachedRpcJiraServer.refreshDetails(CachedRpcJiraServer.java:117)\nat org.eclipse.mylar.internal.jira.JiraServerFacade.refreshServerSettings(JiraServerFacade.java:113)\nat org.eclipse.mylar.internal.jira.JiraRepositoryConnector.updateAttributes(JiraRepositoryConnector.java:325)\nat org.eclipse.mylar.internal.jira.JiraOfflineTaskHandler.downloadTaskData(JiraOfflineTaskHandler.java:75)\nat org.eclipse.mylar.tasks.ui.SynchronizeTaskJob.run(SynchronizeTaskJob.java:102)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)",

    "This just happened to me for the second time today.",
    "Just an FYI, when this happens you can\u0027t click on queries that access that repository anymore.  When you do, you get the AuthenticationException (reported by org.eclipse.mylar.core) put in the error log.\n\nThen, when I right-click on the query and choose synchronize, it doesn\u0027t do anything.  It will start the synch, and put a process in the progress view, but when it completes the task list doesn\u0027t update and nothing is printed to the error log.\n\nI went to the task repository view and tried to update the properties from the repo, but that resulted in the same AuthenticationException (exception this time reported by org.eclipse.core.jobs).  So I opened the repository and followed the same steps I outlined here - bug#164549 - to \"refresh\" the credentials.  This seemed to once again do the trick.  Afterwards, I could safely (without error) synchronize the query as well as update the properties.\n\nSo, it seems I can pretty consistently recover from this issue by manually re-validating my credentials.  Since Mylar already has my credentials saved, would it be possible to catch these two exceptions, execute the logic behind the \"Validate Settings\" button, and retry the original action?  If the original action still fails, then there are other problems - but I figure since this strategy has helped me on more than one occassion, maybe it could be leveraged to automatically recover as well.",
    "I let Eclipse run overnight and, as expected, I got the Authentication exception again.\n\nFor this test, I had my auto-synch policy set to 15 minutes.  So, give or take a min, this happened very consistently every 11 intervals.  Here are the actual times:\n\nNov 22 9:44:02\nNov 23 1:28:21\nNov 23 4:13:22\nNov 23 6:58:22\nNov 23 9:43:23\nNov 23 12:28:24\n\nNow, as I mentioned above, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s odd that I got this error - it was quite expected.  What pertrubs me is the fact that I got it several times without intervening.  So, I can only presume that the connection must have somehow been re-established.  But I can\u0027t tell from my rather sparse error log when that reconnection occurs.\n\nCould this be an issue with the underlying Jira Core Services?  I\u0027m running the more recent 0.9.2 version.  I can\u0027t recall precisely, but when I started using Mylar I think I was only running 0.9.1 - so unless someone has already pinpointed the issue and is working on it, I\u0027ll try reverting back to an older version and see what happens over the next several hours.",
    "That\u0027s correct--you should not have an alternate JIRA Core Services installed.  A dev build with 0.9.2 will be available later this evening, and it would be great if you could try it out and post results here.\n\nI have done some additional fixes for this.  If the connection gets dropped you will see a log message in the log, but these should either be rare or never occur.  Let me know how it goes and I\u0027ll leave this bug open for the time being.",
    "*** Bug 165733 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "I\u0027m not seeing this an anymore with the latest dev build, but don\u0027t have too many queries.  If anyone else is please post.",
    "I won\u0027t get back to my environment until tomorrow.  I\u0027ll do additional testing with the latest dev build then, and post my results here.",
    "I\u0027ve been running the latest fix for a few hours now...so far without issue.  However, I want to go day just to make sure.  If results are still positive by then, I\u0027ll post back and this case can be closed.",
    "By the way, for anyone curious (or stupid) enough to revert the Jira Core Services from 0.9.2 to 0.9.1 - don\u0027t.  My entire task list was lost.  The eclipse error log had one message for each type of loss, for every loss:\n\norg.eclipse.mylar.core: Tasks may have been lost from JiraIssue \u003cstack trace\u003e\norg.eclipse.mylar.core: Tasks may have been lost from BugzillaReport \u003cstack trace\u003e\norg.eclipse.mylar.core: Tasks may have been lost from BugzillaQuery \u003cstack trace\u003e\norg.eclipse.mylar.core: Tasks may have been lost from JiraJiraCustomQuery \u003cstack trace\u003e\netc...\n\nSo, I re-reverted to 0.9.2 and restored my task list from a backup.
