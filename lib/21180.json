    "after applying the patch, validation and browsing works. however, checkout \nfails with different errors for different projects. these errors seem to be \nunrelated to the newline issue:\n\n(1)

    "Your issue is not related. ",
    "I\u0027m not so sure.  When I finally got eclipse to recognize a (cygwin ssh/cvs) checkout, it rewrote some of \nthe CVS/* files in CRLF format when they were previously LF-only.  This resulted in the cygwin ssh/cvs \nclient complaining about \"No such directory X in Y\".  After capturing the output to a file, I found that \nthe filenames were getting embedded CRs in them (i.e. \"X\" was actually \"X^M\").\n\n(In reply to comment #37)\n\u003e Your issue is not related. \n\n(In reply to comment #36)\n\u003e I\u0027m having similar problems -I think- (if its not the same please tell me so I \n\u003e can open a separate issue).\n\u003e \n\u003e At seemingly random times I get the \u0027xxx is not a child of folder yyy\u0027 error \n\u003e message from Eclipse team. The server is a windows cvs server, and I\u0027ve only \n\u003e seen it happen on binary resources.\n\u003e \n",
    "The original problem was due to a connection client that was adding CRs to the \ncommunication stream. We do not intend to modify the CVS client to operate \nunder those considitions.",
    "When I checkout my project, I get \"Unknown response received from cvs server:\".\n The result is the project has only partially downloaded.  When I open some of\nthe files that downloaded, they are incomplete as well.  If I delete those\nfiles, they will still be incomplete.  Its always the same files that produce\nthe error, and they wont fully download.  The other files will download fully\nevery time.\n\nI\u0027m using :ext: method using PuTTY.  CVS version is:\n\nConcurrent Versions System (CVS) 1.11.17 (client/server)",
    "What Eclipse version are you using? Can you try to use extssh and see if it \nworks? Do you have compression set? If so turn it off and see if it works? Is \nthere anything in the error log?",
    "My compression was set to 0.  Just for kicks, I set it to 4 after reading your\nmessage, and the projects downloaded flawlessly.\n\nForgive my ignorance, but I\u0027m new to this software.  After examining the about\ntab, I believe my eclipse version is 2.1.2.  WSAD version is 5.1.1.  Maybe\nextssh would have worked for me, but I have been unable to get the configuration\nin a state that actually works, so I have been sticking with ext.\n\n(In reply to comment #41)\n\u003e What Eclipse version are you using? Can you try to use extssh and see if it \n\u003e works? Do you have compression set? If so turn it off and see if it works? Is \n\u003e there anything in the error log?\n\n",
    "In my environment the real cause actually was too simple to be mentioned. On my\nSolaris server hosting the cvs root, the cvs program ist located under\n/usr/local/bin and all users are getting Bash as default shell. In an\ninteractive login shell $HOME/.bash_login is executed and there the PATH gets\nupdated to include /usr/local/bin. So every logged-in user was able to execute\ncvs and successfully checking out modules from it. In an interactive non-login\nshell (the one Eclipse uses when opening a connection with extssh) only\n$HOME/.bashrc will be executed and all users reporting this problem didn\u0027t have\na .bashrc in their home directory. Creating one and adding the extra path\ninformation (PATH\u003d$PATH:/usr/local/bin; export PATH) to successfully locate the\ncvs program solved the problem.",
    "In Eclipse 3.1.2 I have the same problem, y I was able to connect using the extssh method inside Eclipse, as described in the manual:\n\nhttp://help.eclipse.org/help30/index.jsp?topic\u003d/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/task-team-cmdlineclient.htm\n\n\"3. The \u0027extssh\u0027 connection method\n\nThe extssh connection method is unique to Eclipse CVS and doesn\u0027t exist in the command-line CVS client. If you are using extssh to connect to a SSH2 repository and would like to use the command line client for some CVS operations you can configure the ext connection method to use extssh when inside Eclipse.\n\n   1. Create a new repository location that uses the ext connection method. The repository path, host, and user should be identical to those in the extssh location.\n   2. Open the Team\u003eCVS\u003eExt Connection Method preference page.\n   3. Enable Use another connection method type to connect and choose extssh.\n   4. Now when you use the ext connection method inside Eclipse, extssh will be used instead of an external client.\"\n"
