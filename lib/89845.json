The move to bundle\nmanifests has one drawback...you can not differentiate between a bundle with dot\non its classpath and a bundle with no library.\n\nWhen I fixed this bug I added dot to the classpath when the Bundle-Classpath\nheader is missing. So the test needs to be changed to handle the new case.\n",
