    "The remote XML-RPC errors have been fixed in the latest XML-RPC patch for Trac 0.11. Mylar needs to be updated to expect Date objects instead of integers for Trac 0.11. ",

    "I had problems with the latest development build from trac (0.11dev-r5790) and XMLRPC (Rev. 2358) with latest Patch from Ben (found here: http://trac-hacks.org/ticket/1075) and Mylyn 2.0 of course.\n\nCreate a new ticket raises always an exception: \n\u0027__init__() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given)\u0027 while executing \u0027ticket.status.get()\u0027\nUpdate Attributes gives the same exception.\n\nAfter that I have debugged the function (inside mylyn/eclipse): Call and parameters seems okay, but \"ticket.status.get\" returns alwaye an exception. \"ticket.status.getAll\" is okay! So I have disabled the next calls for each status and generate the integer values manually.\nAfter that a new exception after creating/reading the new task occurs:\nunsubscriptable object in \"getAvailableActions\"\nSo I have disabled the calling for \"getAvailableActions\". I don\u0027t know if the results are needed but after that, the task creating, reading, updating etc. functions properly.\nIf someone needs the patch I can post it but I don\u0027t if there are side effects because I have disabled two rpc-calls.",
    "Sorry, yes now I know why the getAvailableActions method is required: I can\u0027t close/reopen etc a task. Probably it\u0027s a xmlrpc-trac-plugin problem.",
    "This needs be fixed on the Trac side. The patch for the XmlRpcPlugin needs to updated for the latest changes in the Trac trunk.",
    "Due to the changed ticket workflow updating of attributes does not work properly with the latest revision of Trac:\n\njava.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: \"reopened\"\nat java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:48)\nat java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:447)\nat java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:497)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.trac.core.TracXmlRpcClient.getTicketAttributes(TracXmlRpcClient.java:536)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.trac.core.TracXmlRpcClient.updateAttributes(TracXmlRpcClient.java:412)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.trac.core.AbstractTracClient.updateAttributes(AbstractTracClient.java:145)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.trac.ui.wizard.TracCustomQueryPage$4.run(TracCustomQueryPage.java:391)\nat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run(ModalContext.java:113)\n",

    "Please see if the following resolves your \"no more handles\" error: http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn_User_Guide#Browser_Issues ",
    "This could be caused by the HTML preview that was recently added to the Trac editor. Which version of Mylyn were you using before upgrading to the dev build?\n\nMik, maybe we should try to instanciate the browser widget lazily to avoid break down of the task editor when the widget does not work?",
    "The version I used before the SWT problems was mylyn 2.0.0.v20070627-140.\nThe steps described in http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn_User_Guide#Browser_Issues  are not helpful in my environment\n- really I do not need HTML in Mylyn, I want the rich editor\n- I use firefox, not mozilla (BTW: mozilla is deprecated)\n- If I need to connect to Trac via web, I must use HTTPS\n\nThis is a workaround for me:\n- install the latest Mylyn (needed for getting status information from trac)\n- build the trac queries\n- switch back to the old mylyn (the queries still work)\n\nOf course this is unsatisfying, but as long as trac .11 and tracs XLMRPC plugin are marked \"under development\", I wouldn\u0027t pay too much attention on this.\nYou mylyn developers rely on a stable API.",
    "Steffen: yup, we should instantiate the browser widget on demand, since it has not been uncommon for UN*X environments to be misconfigured for the embedded browser.",
    "Opened bug 203107 for fixing the browser widget in the task editor.",
    "Rainer, the latest dev build contains a fix for bug 203107. Please report back if you still get the browser errors when opening the task editor:\n\n http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/downloads/builds.php",
    "Steffen,\n\nlooks good so far. I\u0027m now on Mylyn 2.0.1.v20070920-1000.\nI do not get SWT errors anymore - until I click on the Preview Button, but the upcoming SWT error is expected :-)"
