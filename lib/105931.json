    "I\u0027m trying to get something similar to chapter 2.5.4 of the EMF Book (Dynamic\nEMF, page 35).\nI have a generated EPackage with *abstract* classes that shall serve as super\nclasses for\na number of other (non-generated) classes. These other classes are reflectively\ncomposed\nat runtime. They all inherit one of the abstract classes of the generated EPackage.\n\nWhen I use the EFactory of the dynamic EPackage to create an EObject, it tries\nto locate\nthe lowest super class that is generated. But unfortunately all the generated\nsuper types\nin my generated EPackage are abstract! The create() method of the factory throws a:\n\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The class \u0027ItSystem\u0027 is not a valid classifier\n    at\ncom.sympedia.mde.product.impl.ProductFactoryImpl.create(ProductFactoryImpl.java:45)\n    at org.eclipse.emf.ecore.impl.EFactoryImpl.create(EFactoryImpl.java:207)\n    at com.sympedia.mde.internal.SystemNature.createItSystem(SystemNature.java:537)\n    [...] \n\nEd answered in the newsgroup:\n\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\nYou can\u0027t create a dynamic derived instance of a generated abstract class\nbecause no factory will be able to create the generated abstract instance.  So\nyour workaround (don\u0027t make the generated base classes abstract) is the only way\nto make it work.",
    "I think this is a permanent limitation.  I can\u0027t think of how to fix it.  I\u0027ll\nthink some more and give you time to suggest something...",
    "Eike, \n\nI can\u0027t see any way around this limitation.  If the generated Impl is abstract,\nwe can\u0027t instantiate it unless we generate a derived class that isn\u0027t abstract,\nand because we are trying to support dynamic, that\u0027s not an option either. ",
    "Ed,\n\nI don\u0027t know any way either ;-(\nSo let\u0027s stay with non-abstract base classes..."
