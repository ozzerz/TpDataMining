    "Since 3.2M6, there is a problem with this function. The output for the mac plateform is made of the usual configuration and plugins folder, the startup.jar file but the package \"AppName.app\" is not there. Instead there is two files one named \"Eclipse\" and the other\"AppName\" but they are  not executable. There is also a folder named \"MacOS\".... looks like there is a lack of regrouping all these into a working executable package.\n\nI am not sure about the linux exports but the windows export is correct.\nI am using Eclipse SDK 3.2M6 along with a target made of RCP-SDK 3.2M6 and the Delta-Pack 3.2M6 on Mac OS X 10.4.6 using Java 1.4.2.",
    "Are you trying to export an RCP app?",
    "Yes. Did I post the bug in the wrong place ?",
    "The problem is coming from the delta pack itself that is misshaped. More precisely the launcher files the MacOs folder sitting next to the Eclipse.app should be in the Contents folder.",
    "Fix released for builds \u003c 20060407-1700.",
    "Thanks for trying to fix. Unfortunately, the executables are still not generated correctly. For Linux and Windows exports, there is no more binaries at all (only the plugins, features and configuration folders). \nAs for the mac export there is an empty package named \"AppName.app\" alongside the folders but it is not executable either as its size is of 0 Ko...\n\nI am using eclipse-SDK-N20060408-0010 along with a target made of eclipse-RCP-SDK-N20060408-0010 and the eclipse-RCP-N20060408-0010 on Mac OS X 10.4.6 using Java 1.4.2.\n",
    "To correctly export you need to have the delta pack installed in your target. It seems that you do not have it.",
    "I have the delta-pack installed in my target. If you don\u0027t you will not be able to choose \"export to multiple plateforms\". \nCan you reproduce this bug ?",
    "I have tried to reproduce the problem with M6 from a windows machine exporting on the multiple platforms. Everything worked to the exception of the problem in the delta pack reported here, but when I fixed it everything was fine. Could you please give detailed steps on how to reproduce the pb?",
    "One problem may be that the target.build.properties should be renamed to build.properties in the org.eclipse.platform.launcher feature.  I will investigate why this is failing  at build time.\n\nI do notice in build N20060310-0010, that when I test exporting the template \"Hello World\" RCP app with a \"myrcp\" launcher name, I get a myrcp.app and an Eclipse.app directory in the install, attachment with contents to follow.  If I remove the launcher name, all the files are present under Eclipse.app.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d38164)\napp directories included in Mac rcp export\n\nPascal, any suggestions on what can be done in the case where a launcher name is specified?",
    "My .properties file is named build.properties and even if I don\u0027t specify a launcher name I get these separate files in the mac export",
    "Ok, I have reproduced the problem. In my test I was not changing the launcher name.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d38638)\nError log received when launching the app via startup.jar\n\n",
    "This is with Eclipse 3.2RC1 (Eclipse SDK, Eclipse RCP-SDK, Delta-Pack).\nI can confirm this problem too when you change the name of the launcher.\n\nMoreover if I don\u0027t change the name of the launcher, I have effectively these files in the application folder:\n- folder configuration\n- folder plugins\n- startup.jar file\n- one file named \"Eclipse.app\" which looks like an executable. \n\nThe Eclipse.app is unfortunately not launchable. If you double-click on it nothing will happen !\n\nIf you double-click on startup.jar instead, a workspace folder appears in the application folder, and the application launches but then quits unexpectedly before being able to do anything. Log file attached.",
    "Hello,\nI had the opportunity to test this on a windows machine with the exact same configuration (3.2RC1)... and the mac output obtained on this machine is working perfectly on a mac. This is with no name specified for the Launcher name, if you specify a name for the Launcher, it will result in the problem described in commment #9\n\nI will try again tomorrow on the mac machine and let you know if the problem described in comment #14 is specific to the mac or if it was a transitory bug...\n",
    "Ok found the problem. \nIt is a problem specific on the mac plateform (didn\u0027t tried in linux though). If you export to mac on a mac plateform, the file \"appfolder/eclipse/Contents/MacOS/eclipse\" is set as a \"document\" type instead of a Unix (universal) executable. If you export to mac from a Windows machine, the same file will be a Unix (universal) executable, that\u0027s why it is working.\n\nNotice that these files have both the exact same size. If I replace the \"document\" one by the \"Unix executable\" one everything works perfectly well.\n\nTo illustrate this better please refer to the attachment following (The first \"eclipse\" file is from the mac export done on a windows machine and the second \"eclipse\" file from the mac export done on a mac machine\")\n\nI tried to erase and downloaded/reinstall the whole 3.2RC1 on my mac without any success, having still the same issue",

    "The bugs described in comment 9 and 16/17 are still there in build 20060425... is someone looking into this ?",
    "Be insured that this will be fixed for 3.2. Andrew had to work on some other important stuffs for callisto and I was away for a while.",
    "The problem from comment 9 is the result of several new files added to the mac launcher since 3.1 that the pde.build branding does not know about so they do not get moved over to the new \u003clauncherName\u003e.app directory and get left in the Eclipse.app.  \n\nAs well, the Info.plist file is not getting its contents replaced correctly and the ini file has a reference to the icns file that will also need be be replaced.",

    "Hello, thanks for your patch.\nHow do you apply the patch ? Or in which version of Eclipse will it be included ? (I have the same export problems with Eclipse 3.2 RC2).\n\nDoes it fix also the \"launcher name\" bug ?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d39919)\nVersion of PDE Build containing the patch\n\nThe patch will be released for RC3. In the meantime I would appreciate if you could test if your scenario is working with the attached version of pde build.\nNote that you need to delete the previous version of pde build and start with -clean.",
    "Ok I replaced the plugin folder org.eclipse.pde.build in /Eclipse/Plugins by the patched one. I started Eclipse with -clean (added -clean in the eclipe.ini file)... and tried a multiple plateform export. Actually sorry to say that it is worse. There is no more \"eclipse.app\" at all in the mac output !
