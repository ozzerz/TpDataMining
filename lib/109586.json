    "Can you post a screenshot?",
    "The intro example works fine on win32, so does a more complex rcp app (inc\nwelcome page).  Both exhibit identical issues on linux 64.  Distro in use is\nUbuntu64.  All other views, icons etc appear, so I dont think its X related... \nIll attach a screenshot",

    "I don\u0027t think Eclipse is finding an embeddable mozilla.  What Linux distribution\nare you using?  Did you check the log?",
    "The distro is Ubuntu Hoary 5.0.4 x86_64, fully patched.  Nothing useful in the\nlog.  I have just installed our RCP app onto SLES8 and it has exactly same\nproblem.  common runtime is 1.5.0_04-b05.\n\nDoes anyone know of a linux platform that the intro is known to work on?",
    "It SHOULD work on all of them, even if it can\u0027t find mozilla.  In that event it should fall back to its SWT \nrenderer.\n\nAdding Mazen.",
    "Ubuntu does not provide a gre.conf file.\n\n  http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d13750\n\nYou can point it at mozilla by setting the environment variable\nMOZILLA_FIVE_HOME to /usr/lib/mozilla",
    "Under SLES8, mozilla is in /opt/mozilla, setting MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME here or\n/opt/mozilla/lib (with plugin folder present) has no effect.\n\nUnder Ubuntu, I have firefox and mozilla available, setting MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME to\n/usr/lib/mozilla (with plugin folder present) has no effect.  Setting it to\n/usr/local/mozilla-firefox (with plugin folder present) has no effect.\n\nFollowing on the GRE thread (I dont know anything about it), the /etc/gre.d\nfolder didnt exist so I created it and added the gre.conf file as directed, to\nno effect.\n\nSetting preferences to use mozilla over default system web browser changes\nnothing (use internal web browser is greyed out).\n\nI even added the /usr/lib/mozilla and plugins folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  None\nof which had any effect....",
    "To keep the download small, mozilla-firefox from mozilla.org does not include\nembedding support (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d262453).\n\nHowever, the mozilla from ubuntu should work fine, as should the mozilla-firefox\nfrom ubuntu which does support embedding.  Do you have a\n/usr/lib/mozilla/libxpcom.so file?  What version of mozilla is installed?\n\nYou can test this by opening the internal web browser view in Eclipse.  If it\ncannot find mozilla, there will be a details button in the view that will show\nyou the stack trace.  Can you post it here to confirm that it\u0027s not working?",
    "no /usr/lib/mozilla/libxpcom.so is present, firefox rev is 1.0.6-ubuntu0.2\n\nI just installed the 1.0.6-ubuntu0.2-dev libraries just in case, to no effect.\n\nThe view doesnt break, see attach #1 no stack in the log, no error reported\nanywhere that I can see.  \n\nThe app can find mozilla, see successfully launched help in attach #3.  \n",
    "Just completed a sweep of the os looking for the libxpcom.so file, found under\n/usr/lib/mozilla-firefox, I set MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME accordingly, no effect.",
    "Sorry, I should have been clearer.  You need the mozilla-browser package for\nthere to be an xpcom in /usr/lib/mozilla.  Also, there is a difference between\nthe embedded browser, and the firefox launched with the help.  The embedded\nbrowser is for embedding in an Eclipse window, while the help can be launched\nsimply by exec\u0027ing mozilla-firefox from your PATH.\n\nThis bug is rapidly getting confusing and I apologize.  Can you confirm that\nwith MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME set to /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox that the Intro page and\nembedded browser view works in the hosting Eclipse, and then try and get your\nRCP application working?  In Eclipse, use:\n\n   Window \u003e Show View \u003e Other \u003e Basic \u003e Internal Web browser\n\nAnd try and load a webpage.  Also, test with Help \u003e Welcome.",
    "Pointing MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME at /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox (which contains the\nlibxpcom.so file) does allow me to launch an embeded browser from within\nFirefox.  The intro example project now works, *however* the larger application\nI have still gives an empty page.\n\nOn my exported RCP application, setting the MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME does allow the\ninternal browser to launch a URL, but the welcome page is still a blank,\nreshowing the welcome page after a browser has been successully opened/closed\nproduces the same result.\n",
    "what is the Intro sample that you now have working? is it the sample RCP app \nwith Intro that you get from PDE templates? \nFor your exported app, can you please post the markup that you have for Intro \nextension and introConfig extension.\nalso, create a .options file in the same directory as your eclipse.exe install \nand try running with debug mode (ie: eclipse -debug).\nPut this in the .options file :\n\norg.eclipse.ui.intro/trace/logInfo\u003dtrue\norg.eclipse.ui.intro/trace/logPerformance\u003dfalse\norg.eclipse.ui.intro/debug\u003dtrue\n\ncan you post what gets generated in the .log file?\n\n\n ",
    "It may be directly linked to the presentation, my RCP app only had a\n\u003cimplementation kind\u003d\"html\" os\u003d\"win32\"/\u003e\n\nI think this may be the cause, will test  \u003cimplementation kind\u003d\"swt\"\nos\u003d\"linux,macosx\"/\u003e when 64bit sun VM doesnt stops crashing on me.\n\nWill post back to confirm this is what it was.  Should have read the\ninstructions, sob.",
    "Has this been resolved to your satisfaction Andy?",
    "I understand the problem now, I was tussling with the following:\n\na) My config only had \u003cimplementation kind\u003d\"html\" os\u003d\"win32\"/\u003e, it needed to\nhave os\u003d\"win32, linux, macosx\".\n\nb) When launching Eclipse from a shortcut on the desktop EVEN if the\n/etc/bash.bashrc file has the correct MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME set (confirmed through\nshells) the IDE wont see it.  \n\nc) Unfortunately, even setting a MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME environment variable in the\nRun.. launcher settings (append has no effect - the blank screen situation) and\nreplace causes a SWT error (without changing any code/plugin config etc from the\ntest of running with an externally defined MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME)  :-\n\n## SWT error:\n----------------\norg.eclipse.swt.SWTError: No more handles [gtk_init_check() failed]\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:2968)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.createDisplay(Display.java:757)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.create(Display.java:746)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Device.\u003cinit\u003e(Device.java:141)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.\u003cinit\u003e(Display.java:429)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.\u003cinit\u003e(Display.java:420)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.Workbench.createDisplay(Workbench.java:394)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.PlatformUI.createDisplay(PlatformUI.java:155)\n\tat com.dolby.pics.ut.UTApplication.run(UTApplication.java:25)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run(PlatformActivator.java:226)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:376)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:163)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke\n------------\n\n\nSo, yes, I can make this work under linux if I set an environment variable from\na script or command line before running eclipse, but If this is not done, there\nseems no way to \u0027tweak\u0027 the intro page into life.  Shouldn\u0027t I be able to\nconfigure the runtime environment variables to a launched process?  Isnt that\nthe point of a runtime environment configuration?\n\nIm also a little concerned that an environment variable has to be tweaked in\norder to make this work on non-win32 platforms, its not just install and work...\n  It would be useful to be able to provide this through the\nplugin_customization.ini file, setting up some default platform locations (eg,\nlinux, most people will use /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox, macosx would have its own\netc).\n\nCheers.",
    "Passing to SWT for comment.",
    "I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re having so much trouble.  UNIX can be complicated :)\n\n\u003e b) When launching Eclipse from a shortcut on the desktop EVEN if the\n\u003e /etc/bash.bashrc file has the correct MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME set (confirmed through\n\u003e shells) the IDE wont see it.\n\nWhen you run a shortcut on the desktop, its environment is inherited from the\nprocess that started the desktop session (gnome-session, kdeinit, etc).  Any\nchanges to /etc/bash.bashrc require this process be restarted, and depend on\nthat process being spawned from a bash session. If you\u0027re still unsure about\nwhat\u0027s going on, ask your distribution or someone from GNOME or KDE what the\nright place is to change the environment for launched applications.\n\nWhen you start a bash process in a shell, it will obviously get its environment\nfrom /etc/bash.bashrc\n\n\u003e c) Unfortunately, even setting a MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME environment variable in the\n\u003e Run.. launcher settings (append has no effect - the blank screen situation)\n\nTry also setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  When you run a launch config, Eclipse\nexecutes \"java\" directly and does not use the eclipse launcher.  The eclipse\nlauncher is the executable sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include whatever is in your\nMOZILLA_FIVE_HOME.  This won\u0027t be done if you use a launch config.\n\n\u003e replace causes a SWT error [...]\n\u003e org.eclipse.swt.SWTError: No more handles [gtk_init_check() failed]\n\nWhen you replace the environment, you replace all variables, including DISPLAY.\nGTK+ is failing because it can\u0027t open your X display.\n\n\nTo answer your concern about environment tweaking, there is a standard for how\nto find an embeddable Mozilla, and it\u0027s the \"gre.conf\" configuration file which\nis read by the eclipse launcher executable. The work now is to ensure that all\nof the distributions ship it and point it at an embeddable Mozilla. It\u0027s\nunfortunate that Mozilla doesn\u0027t provide good documentation for this, but\nregardless please file bugs like the Ubuntu one I linked to above.",
    "I\u0027m going to close this as INVALID since I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any bug here to\nfix (besides filing bugs against the distributions in question), but please\nre-open if you disagree."
