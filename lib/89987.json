I have to kill it and restart.",
    "Can you provide a buildfile that causes the problem?",
    "This is the build that generates an executable for the batch compiler using ecj.\nSo you need to set up lot of things to run it.\nIn fact I am not completely sure that this is the script. I assume this is the\none, because I got this in the console and the script stopped running.",
    "If you re-run the build, is the problem reproduceable or random?",
    "seems to be random. I restarted it and it seems to be fine now. I\u0027ll keep you\ninform of the progress. The script takes 30 minutes to run.",
