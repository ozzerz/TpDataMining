    "For some strange reason whenever I start Eclipse I get an error.\nThe error begins like this:\n----------------\n!SESSION Dec 08, 2004 22:01:25.767 ---------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dM200409161125\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_04\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi Dec 08, 2004 22:01:25.767\n!MESSAGE Startup error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.NoSuchFieldError: equals\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.SimpleHashtable.\u003cinit\u003e(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.Parser2.\u003cinit\u003e(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.apache.crimson.parser.XMLReaderImpl.parse(Unknown Source)\n----------------\n\nIt happens with both Eclipse 3.0 and 3.0.1.  I think that one of the latest MS \nsecurity patches may have broken it, because this worked a couple days ago and \na \"company required\" security patch was installed and now it doesn\u0027t work.\nThis may be a stretch but my point is that Eclipse 3.0 used to work on my\nmachine.\n\nMy gut feeling is that this is NOT an eclipse bug/problem but a problem in the \nenvironment, but I tried running a custom written java program it runs ok.\nI\u0027m using JDK 1.4.2_04 on Win2000.\n\nI googled for the error and didn\u0027t find anything relavent, and searched Eclipse \nbugs and didn\u0027t find any match on \"java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: equals\".\nI\u0027ll keep looking but I\u0027m hoping someone can give me some pointers.\nGoing back to Emacs hurts now that I\u0027m hooked on eclipse. :-)\n\nKeep up the good work.\nThanks,\nPatrick",
    "Well I got Eclipse to work again.  How?  By reloading Java.  I first\nloaded JDK 1.5 and ran Eclipse and it worked.  I then tried Eclipse\n3.0 with JDK 1.4.2_04 to see if the problem really went away.  It did\ngo away.  Eclipse 3.0 now starts up with either version of Java.  I\u0027ll\nstick with JDK 1.5 since I\u0027ve been meaning to upgrade.\n\nSo what caused the problem I was having?  I\u0027m not (yet) sure.  I hope\nthis is either a fluke, or that my entry helps the next person out!\n",
    "I\u0027m mentioning this only in the off chance that it was a combination of \ninstalling JDK 1.5 AND renaming the workbench.xml file that \"fixed the problem\".\n\nWhen looking through my notes.  I realized I also renamed \n\u003cyourWorkspace\u003e/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/workbench.xml\nto workbench-old.xml but this still didn\u0027t fix the problem.  Eclipse would \nstill not start after this change.\n\nI tried this BEFORE I downloaded JDK 1.5.\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d16484)\nEclipse error log file that includes full stack trace\n\nThis file is the original error log file (with the full stack trace)\nof the problem.  The filename was \nc:\\P\\eclipse3.0\\configuration\\1102559813930.log\nbut I don\u0027t think that name matters to anyone.\n",
    "Wrong resolution (should only be marked fixed if changes were made to fix it)",
