    "See bug # https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d50448\n\nThe \u003c?eclipse version\u003d\"3.0\"?\u003e line without having \"runtime compatibility\" as a\nrequired plugin can cause your GEFPlugin class to try to be instantiated with\ndefault ctor, which you don\u0027t have. This causes stack traces and the GEFPlugin\nwill not be initialized.\n\nAs you can see from the bug referenced above, unless you are going to be a\nfull-blown OSGi bundle, it is best to simply remove the version\u003d3.0 line.\n\nThe way this occurred for me was I was accessing a class in my plugin that\ninherited from a GEF class. Upon the load of the GEF class it tried to start the\nGEFPlugin up as an OSGi bundle in new mode, and not in old mode. And it threw an\nexception.",
    "Thanks Rich.  We aware of this problem which is introduced if you use \nintegration builds after M6 (0128 I think).  It\u0027s funny how they make these \nworld changes and you\u0027d better be subscribed to the right mailing list if you \nwant your code to work!\n\nAre you able to reproduce any bugs using the correct dependencies specified \nfrom the GEF download page?  If not, this should be closed since a solution is \nalready in HEAD.",
    "I\u0027m using GEF driver I20040210 with Eclipse driver I20040209. This Eclipse\ndriver is actually up-level from the driver specified on the GEF download page\n(GEF is specifying the six-week old M6 driver on the GEF download page).\n\nAnd yes, the problem occurs with this combination.\n\nWhen I manually removed the \u003ceclipse... version\u003d\u003e line, everything came up fine.\nNo problems. With them in as it is built, you get this error when bringing up\nthe visual editor:\n\norg.osgi.framework.BundleException: The BundleActivator\norg.eclipse.gef.GEFPlugin is invalid\n\tat\norg.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.Bundle.loadBundleActivator(Bundle.java:176)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.BundleContext.start(BundleContext.java:987)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.BundleHost.startWorker(BundleHost.java:403)\n\tat org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.Bundle.start(Bundle.java:312)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseClassLoader.findLocalClass(EclipseClassLoader.java:58)\n",
    "Also, instead of removing the 3.0, adding runtime compatibility will be\nsufficient too, which is what I believe you had done, you added the runtime\ncompatibility. Can you get a GEF build out immediately with this change so that\nwe can use it without having to manually change the plugin.xml files?\n\nThanks,\nRich",
    "The I20040212 build has the fix",
    "I\u0027ve verified that it works.",
