    "Using attachment 60820, if I try to create an Axis2 client moving the slider to Test, I would get the exception:\n\nIWAB0014E Unexpected exception occured.\n  \n      java.lang.NullPointerException\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.consumption.ui.widgets.test.WebServiceClientTestArrivalCommand.getBean(WebServiceClientTestArrivalCommand.java:220)\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.consumption.ui.widgets.test.WebServiceClientTestArrivalCommand.execute(WebServiceClientTestArrivalCommand.java:104)\n      at org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.core.fragment.CommandFragmentEngine.runCommand(CommandFragmentEngine.java:414)\n\nThis is because the xxxProxy bean, which is expected by the JAX-RPC sample JSP) is not generated.  The JAX-RPC sample JSP should be removed from showing up for the Axis2 runtime for now until further investigation on how easy it would be for supporting it.",
    "After some debugging, it turns out that the problem is with going into the Web service client test page, which expects the XXXProxy bean to be generated.  This is expected even if the user set the Test preference to the WSE.  The JAX-RPC sample JSP should not show up for the Axis2 runtime unless the Axis2 plugin specifically defined an extension to the Tester extension to allow support for the Axis2 runtime.  I\u0027ve opened bug 180304 to track the problem with always expecting the proxy bean to be generated.  Depending on whether we fix that bug in WTP 2.0 or not, we might need to workaroud that problem for Axis2.",
    "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 180304 ***",
    "saw that related issue to this  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d180304 has been fixed. \nWill test this with the Axis2 plugins. form the v200705021333 build and update the issue. ",
    "tested with the 20070505 integration build. \nverified fixed. Closing the issue. "
