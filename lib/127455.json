    "Hi,\nI tried to run the command line version of buckminster with my components, and got some problems, so I enabled logging, which did fail itself :)\nI guess I need to initialize something, but the reffered file: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file\u003d/technology/buckminster/products/buckminster.product-1.0.0.M2sp001.zip\nis not available :(\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.buckminster.core.Logger.getLogConfigurationURLForStdOutOrErr(Logger.java:554)\n        at org.eclipse.buckminster.core.Logger.getConfigurationURL(Logger.java:534)\n        at org.eclipse.buckminster.core.Logger.configure(Logger.java:190)\n        at org.eclipse.buckminster.headless.internal.Launcher.run(Launcher.java:87)\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run(PlatformActivator.java:226)\n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:376)\n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:163)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)",
    "Sorry, my mistake. I was running it on a 3.1.1\nBut the mentioned zip is unavailable anyway.",
    "Ok, so I\u0027ll delete the answer I had begun typing...:-)\n\nAnyway, no - that build is missing. Unfortunenately, there is no \u0027browse\u0027 capability for product builds. The latest, however is \u0027buckminster.product-1.0.0.20060202.zip\u0027.\n\nThat said, while playing around, you might as well use the regular buckminster install you get into your IDE. Assuming the regular \u0027update\u0027 process works normally, after you restart the IDE you should have a \u0027buckminster\u0027 executable alongside the eclipse executable. I.e. you get a headless environment there as well using the exact same code as in the \u0027product\u0027 packaging. Once you get everything working working you can tackle the product (and that one always requires customization to fit your needs). The main idea behind the \u0027product\u0027 is simply to enable a smaller package than the full IDE with all the paraphernalia it requires. But, if you\u0027d rather start off with the product right now anyway, please holler and I\u0027ll show you how to get it set up.",
    "Ah ok, I expected something exciting in it :)\nBut setting up a minimal product is still relevant to me as I need to compile against 3.1.2.",
    "Sure - though using the product packaging wont truly help you with the issue of Eclipse 3.2 vs 3.1. The product comes bundled with a (minium) set of Eclipse 3.2 plugins anyway. The problem really belongs to a different space, namely of getting the rmap correct so that eclipse components will be materialized and/or bound into the workspace rather than falling back to \u0027plugins running in this instance\u0027. You may also need to add cspex (cspec extension) files to your plugins where your dependencies on eclipse components is augmented to specify max version requirements (actually, I\u0027m unsure if maybe that can be done directly on the plugin manifests nowadays). \n\nAnyway, if you\u0027re interested in the product packaging, see here: http://wiki.tada.se/display/buckminster/Buckminster+packaging, for an initial dump of packaging descriptions (it\u0027s a cut and paste job so the formatting is currently awful, I\u0027ll correct that when returning for restructuring that part...)."
