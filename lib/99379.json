    "Using Eclipse 3.1RC1 with Rational ClearCase Remote Client:\n\nCode that used to work in Eclipse 3.0 now throws an exception:\n1:\t\tReader reader \u003d new StringReader(string);\n2:\t\tXMLReader parser \u003d XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();\n\nline 2 throws org.xml.sax.SAXException: System property org.xml.sax.driver not \nspecified\n\tat org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader(Unknown Source)\n\nThis problem is JRE dependent.\nIt works for:  IBM JRE 1.4.2\nIt throws a SAXException for Sun JRE 1.4.2_05.\n\n\nThis used to work in Eclipse 3.0, so we are wondering if you know any \nspecifics to make it work again.\nIs it a new Eclipse bug ?\nIs there some extra configuration we need to do?\n\nPete Carmichael has sent John Arthorne some additional information via email.",
    "Could you tell us the list of jars you have in your plugins (attach your\nplugin.xml or manifest).",
    "This appears to be a VM bug.  Same thing happens if you run the following \nclass as a Java application on a Sun 1.4.2 VM\n\npackage testxml;\n\nimport org.xml.sax.SAXException;\nimport org.xml.sax.XMLReader;\nimport org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLReaderFactory;\n\npublic class TestXML {\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) throws SAXException {\n\t\tXMLReader parser \u003d XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader();\n\t}\n}\n\nThis is not an eclipse issue.  Please report the bug to the VM vendor."
