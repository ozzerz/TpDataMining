    "I don\u0027t have a complete repro case, but I occasionally get null exceptions in\nRenderingViewPane.memoryBlocksAdded.\n\nCaused by: java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat\norg.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.views.memory.RenderingViewPane$1.run(RenderingViewPane.java:115)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.RunnableLock.run(RunnableLock.java:35)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Synchronizer.runAsyncMessages(Synchronizer.java:123)",
    "I reproduced by modifying my testcase to close the Meomry View after a new memory block is added.  \n\nThis looks like a timing problem.  After a memory block is added, the rendering schedules the handling of the event to run on the UI thread asynchronously.  We could get into a condition that the view is disposed after the runnable is scheduled.  By the time the runnable is run, the view is already disposed, hence fTabFolderForMemoryBlock becomes null.\n\n",
    "Check if the view pane is disposed before handling memoryBlockAdded and memoryRenderingAdded events.  \n\nThe handling of the remove events already have checks to see if the tab folder is disposed before the events are handled.\n\nFixed in RenderingViewPane.",
    "Darin, please verify.\nThx...\nSamantha",
    "Verified."
