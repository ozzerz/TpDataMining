    "When I import an EAR which has an EJB module with an associated EJB client\nmodule, the relationship between the two doesn\u0027t appear to be preserved. To\nreproduce the problem you can do the following:\n\n1) Create an EJB project named \"TestEJBProject\". Accept all the defaults and\n   associate with an EAR called \"TestEJBProjectEAR\". By default, a client\n   project called \"TestEJBClientProject\" will also be created.\n\n2) If you get an EJBArtifactEdit for \"TestEJBProject\" and call its\n   getEJBClientJarModule(), you will get the correct TestEJBClientProject\n   IVirtualComponent.\n\n3) Export TestEJBProjectEAR as an EAR file to the local filesystem.\n\n4) Delete all TestEJBProject, TestEJBClientProject and TestEJBProjectEAR from\n   the workspace.\n\n5) Import The EAR exported in step 3.\n\n6) If you call EJBArtifactEdit\u0027s getEJBClientJarModule(), you\u0027ll now get an\n   NPE:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.ejb.componentcore.util.EJBArtifactEdit.getEJBClientJarModu\nle(EJBArtifactEdit.java:222)",

    "Fixed, the problem was that the reference component for EJBClient in the \nEJB .wtpmodules was not being set. ",
