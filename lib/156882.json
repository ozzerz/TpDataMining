    "We would like to be able to use UML 2.0 enumerations in Classic mode. This probably requires changes to both the metamodel (Enumeration would be a subtype of Type, and would have an ordered collection of EnumerationLiterals) and the mapping file. Our application uses MagicDraw 11 and 11.5. This would enable a much cleaner use of enumerations for attributes than our present solution, which creates ad hoc stereotypes, e.g.,\n\nmyAttribute: String \u003c\u003cenumerated\u003dChoiceA!ChoiceB!ChoiceC\u003e\u003e\n\nReal UML 2.0 enumerations could also be subclassed, something not possible with the above kludge.",

    "OAW ships with the obsolete JDOM version \"1.0beta10\" which is unfortunately not compatible with the current version \"1.0\".\nThus one gets the following compile error when integrating OAW into a build environment that uses the latest JDOM:\n    java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.jdom.Parent.addContent(ILorg/jdom/Content;)Lorg/jdom/Parent;\n    at org.openarchitectureware.core.frontends.xmi.toolsupport.uml.magicdraw.MagicDrawModuleMerger.merge(MagicDrawModuleMerger.java:302)\n\nI suggest that MagicDrawModuleMerger should be updated and that JDOM 1.0 should be included in OAW.",
    "sorry I just messed up with my browser tabs... the last comment was intended for BUG 157142",
    "FIXED\n\nAdded DataType, Enumeration and EnumerationLiteral.\n\nExtended Unittests and fixed mapping for MagicDraw 10/11.",
    "I haven\u0027t yet been able to test this on a new OAW candidate release, and haven\u0027t been able to build OAW from CVS, but I can see from the source code that Karsten has implemented this change, and I take his word for it that it works!"
