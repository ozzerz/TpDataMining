    "Clicking on a stacktrace (generated by JRockit) in the console gives you a \ndialog saying the source could not be found. The reason is that JRockit\u0027s \nstacktraces are formated a little bit differently. They include the method \nsignature:\n\njava.lang.Exception: sdsd\n\tat MyClass.main([Ljava.lang.String;)V(R.java:16)\n\nThus the parsing code in JavaStackTraceHyperlink needs to be updated. I will \nattach a patch for M8 which fixes this.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d9151)\npatch for JavaStackTraceHyperlink.java\n",
    "modified patch slightly - perform one search for the first \u0027(\u0027 rather than two \nsearches for the last \u0027(\u0027.",
    "Changes in JavaStackTraceHyperlink. Please verify, Kevin.",
    "verified",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d36849)\nUpdated patch compatible with 3.1.2\n\nThis patch performs the same function as the original patch in a way compatible with the 3.1.2 release of the base file.",
    "For some reason, this bug was patched but never actually released. See: http://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui/ui/org/eclipse/jdt/internal/debug/ui/console/JavaStackTraceHyperlink.java?rev\u003d1.7\u0026content-type\u003dtext/vnd.viewcvs-markup\n             \nThe patch original patch is now incompatible with 3.1.2. I have created and attached a new patch which corrects the issue.\n",
    "This bug is still present in 3.2rc5. Patches have been available for YEARS now. What gives?"
