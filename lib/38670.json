    "I created a model according to the tutorial directions but changed the names of\nthe package, model, and uri. The java model builds and generates fine. However\nwhen I go to run the model editor I get a ClassNoDef exception when running the\nwizard. The names of the directories are: simplemodel, simplemodel.edit, and\nsimplemodel.editor (all sub-directories of eclipse/workspace.) The\nSimplemodelModelWizard (in simplemodel.editor) cannot see the class\nSimplemodelPackage. I noted that the .edit and .editor directories had a runtime\nsub-directory to store the class files (distinct from the java sources) but the\nsimplemodel directory did not. Creating the runtime and copying the class files\nthere created a work-around and the model editor became functional.\n\nRunning J2SE 1.4.1_03, Eclipse 2.1, EMF 1.1.0\n\nStack trace:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui.workbench 4 2 Jun 09, 2003 15:39:43.376\n!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in:\n\"org.eclipse.ui.workbench\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/foliage/emf/simplemodel/SimplemodelPackage\n    at\ncom.foliage.emf.simplemodel.presentation.SimplemodelModelWizard.\u003cinit\u003e(SimplemodelModelWizard.java:99)\n    at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\n...",
    "Sorry, this was operator error. I re-read the tutorial and discovered I should\nhave specified the output directory to be \"runtime\". (It appears that this is\ncurrently hard-coded into the EMF plug-in.)",
    "The user must compile into a runtime directory because that\u0027s what the \nplugin.xml expects."
