    "When running the JUnit test using the IAC instead of the RAC, the \nexecution file does not get created on the Test Navigator. But when you\nuse the RAC and run the JUnit test, the execution file gets created to \nsee result file is generated in Test Navigator.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\nUse windows XP \nUsing the IAC\nInstall TPTP-4.1.0-200511170100 over eclipse\nCreate a java project, File;New;Project\nCreate a JUnit test, File;New;Other\nSelect TPTP JUnit Test \nClick the tab \"Test Methods\" and add couple or more test case\nClick the tab \"Behavior\" and add invocation, select all testcase \nRun the JUnit test Run;Run\n\nUsing the RAC from the build TPTP-4.1.0-200511170100 (Windows-IA32)\nUse the steps above, but this time use the RAC to run the JUnit test.\nYou will see the execution file is created on the Test Navigator.",
    "\nI was unable to reproduce with the November, 17 build you list below -- please\ntry to remove the %TEMP%/IBMRAC directory if it exists.  I believe there is some\ntemporary IAC state that is stored here that might influence the behavior seen\nin this defect description.  After removing this temporary IAC directory restart\nand try agian. \n\nRe-rest to see if you can get it to fail again.\n",
    "\nAn InactiveProcessException is thrown and shows up in the PDE error log and it therefore appears to be failing waiting for process notification of successful launch (launch of the session process).  It fails before the test is deployed and executed and therefore no execution results are seen when using IAC.\n\n",
    "Only reproduce on some machines with the Sun JDK.\nIt would need further investigation.\nRe-targeted to 4.2.",
    "\nThis needs to be examined in more detail within the IAC code via Samson or other on that team.  I just tested running a simple JUnit test on IAC and here are the results:\n\no  IBM JDK 1.4.2 and 5.0 behave correctly (test runs and logs results)\no  Sun JDK 5.0 behaves correctly (test runs and logs results)\n\nThe following VM, Sun JDK 1.4.2 (1.4.2_09-b05), behaves badly by having issues with launching the test runner process (the test session VM instructs the agent controller to launch the runner process and the runner process is never seen launched):\n\neclipse.buildId\u003dI20060208-0848\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_09\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nCommand-line arguments:  -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86\n\norg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.launch(TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.java:417)\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.launchTestExecution(TestExecutionHarness.java:2058)\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.access$2(TestExecutionHarness.java:1856)\nat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$2.run(TestExecutionHarness.java:692)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\nI\u0027m not sure how serious this issue is now since all 1.5 and later VMs behave nicely with this -- but anybody wanting to use Sun JDK 1.4.2 (1.4.2_09-b05)\n",
    "Hello. We have just tested the same scenario using the latest TPTP 4.2 development build with Sun 1.4.2_09-b05 and it now works fine. Please verify. Thanks.\n"
