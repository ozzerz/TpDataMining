    "With Eclipse 3.3 RC4, when I launch the following command from my Eclipse installation directory\njava -cp plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.3.0.v20070606.jar org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command displayHelp -noexec\n\nI get this error message:\njava.lang.Exception: File c:\\eclipse\\startup.jar does not exists.  Pass a correct -eclipsehome option\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.standalone.Eclipse.ensureStartupJarExists(Eclipse.java:177)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.standalone.Eclipse.prepareCommand(Eclipse.java:49)\n\tat org.eclipse.help.internal.standalone.Eclipse.run(Eclipse.java:88)\n\nI get the same error when I try to start the standalone Infocenter with the following command:\njava -cp plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.3.0.v20070606.jar org.eclipse.help.standalone.Infocenter -command start -noexec\n\nThe \"-noexec\" option works with Eclipse 3.2.2, for instance.",
    "Yes, I saw this too. The error message means that the -eclipsehome parameter is required. The -eclipsehome parameter is described here: http://help.eclipse.org/stable/index.jsp?topic\u003d/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/ua_help_setup_standalone.htm\n\n-eclipsehome eclipseInstallPath - specifies Eclipse installation directory. This directory is a parent to \"plugins\" directory and eclipse executable. The option must be provided, when current directory from which infocenter is launched, is not the same as Eclipse installation directory.\n\nAdd to your command something like:\n-eclipsehome \u003cwhere_eclipse_is_installed\u003e\n\nFor example:\njava -cp plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.3.0.v20070606.jar\norg.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command displayHelp -eclipsehome eclipse -noexec\n\n--Lee Anne",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Yes, I saw this too. The error message means that the -eclipsehome parameter is\n\u003e required. \n\nI don\u0027t think that\u0027s the problem. As I previously mentioned, the directory from which I launch the standalone help (or infocenter) is the same as my Eclipse installation directory. So, according to the documentation, I shouldn\u0027t have to specify an eclipsehome parameter.\n\nFurthermore, the following command works:\njava -cp plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.3.0.v20070606.jar org.eclipse.help.standalone.Help -command displayHelp\n\nThe problem is that startup.jar no longer exists. org.eclipse.help.internal.standalone.Eclipse.java should be modified accordingly.\n\nAfter applying the following workaround, my \"-noexec\" commands worked:\nhttp://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox_Launcher#Startup.jar\n\nBtw, it says \"copy this bundle...\": is it safe to move the bundle, instead?",
    "My suspicion is that moving the bundle would break your eclipse.exe launcher, though I have not tried it. I imagine it could have other adverse side effects.\n\nI have also reproduced the bug with and without the -eclipsehome flag.\n\nThis should certainly be fixed in the 3.4 stream and considered for 3.3.1.",
    "Yes, we need to fix this. Targeting 3.4.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d72635)\npatch\n\nThis was not an entirely trivial fix. The new startup jar has a version number on it, so it can\u0027t be hard coded like it was before. I changed the method that checks for existence of the startup jar to actually look through the plugins directory under eclipsehome for something that starts with \"org.eclipse.equinox.launcher\" and ends with \".jar\". If it does not find one, it throws an exception as before. If it finds one, it returns the path.",
    "Fixed in HEAD",
    "Fixed in 3.3.1",
