    "Example output from \"Console\":\n\n@@@@\n\njava.util.MissingResourceException: Can\u0027t find resource for bundle \njava.util.PropertyResourceBundle, key icon_path\n\tat java.util.ResourceBundle.getObject(ResourceBundle.java:382)\n\tat java.util.ResourceBundle.getString(ResourceBundle.java:354)\n\n@@@@@\n\nIt would be nice to be able to click on \"java.util.ResourceBundle.getObject\n(ResourceBundle.java:382)\" or just \"ResourceBundle.java:382\" to open that type \nto the specific line (same with \"ResourceBundle.java:354\")-- could be indicated \nby a hyperlink.\n\nRight now one has to:\nselect \"ResourceBundle\" and click on \"Open Type\" from \"Console\"\u0027s pop-up menu, \ngo to the opened file and use its\u0027 pop-up menu \"Go to line...\" (or use keyboard \nshortcut), but it would be much more convenient to be able to do it with just \none click.\n\nAs a \"temporary fix\": If one would select \"ResourceBundle.java:382\" JDT should \nbe able to parse the number after the colon, i.e. \"382\", and automatically run \nthe \"Go to line...\"-action after the \"Open Type\"-action ...\n\nSebastian Davids",

    "The OpenOnType action in the console has always worked in two ways.  If there \nis a selection in the console, only the selection is parsed.  If there is no \nselection, the entire line where the caret is currently located is parsed.  In \nboth cases, if a line number is present, this is parsed so that when the editor \nis opened, the specified line is revealed and selected.  Thus the quick way to \nuse this action is to simply click on the line of interest in the console, then \nright click to \"Open on Type\".\n\nVerified.",
    "One additional note: a recent enhancement to this action has now made things a \nlittle easier still.  You can now double click on a line in the console to \nperform the \"Open on Type\" action instead of single clicking on it, then right-\nclicking to \"Open on Type\".",
    "Well checked it out myself ... it worked.\n\nBut ... I think it should be documented somewhere and there should be \na \"visual\" hint somewhere.\n"
