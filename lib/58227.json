    "Here is the environment I have.1.3.0_20040405_1511 from the eclipse.org site.  \nI downloaded the dependent projects (GEF, EMF, eclipse).  I started eclipse.  \nThen I took the source code of org.eclipse.hyades.uml2sd.ui from cvs \n(dev.eclipse.org) from the branch that is taged hyades_v1_3_0_20040405_1511.  I \ncreated a probe based on this version of the org.eclipse.hyades.uml2sd.ui.  \nThen I self-hosted.  I imported an apache access log and error log and created \na time correlation.  Then I tried to open the log interaction view.  This is \nwhen I got the following exception.\n\njava.lang.ClassFormatError: org/eclipse/hyades/uml2sd/ui/view/ScrollView \n(Invalid start_pc/length in local var table)\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass0(Native Method)\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(Unknown Source)",

    "It seems if I specify a package name in the target attribute it does not apply \nthe probe to the specified package.

It targeted the draw method and excluded the other methods.  \nHowever, once I add a package the probe does not get called.",
    "The previous comment was not for this bug.  This is a different bug that I will \nopen.",
    "This is a good one. It all comes down to padding. The tableswitch instruction \nis variable-length: it gets padded so the table length and entries align on a \nfour-byte boundary (counting from the start of the function). Thus the segment \nof this function after the \"entry\" insertion actually got SMALLER by being \ninstrumented. This revealed a bug in our local variable table patching logic, \nwhich never accounted for entries whose start+length were at the end of the \noriginal function.\n\nFixed now: I added a special pass to handle these variable table entries.\n",
