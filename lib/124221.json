    "This is a multi-thread issue posted in the news group. The openReportDesign() method on reportEngine should support multi-thread environment, i.e, different worker threads in the BIRT engine caller application should be able to use the same report engine instance to open a report design simultaneously. We need to have this fixed for BIRT 2.0. \n\nHello,\n\nCan I use BIRT in a multi-thread environment ?\n\nWhen i try to use it, i have a:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat \norg.eclipse.birt.report.model.parser.StructureState.createStructure(StructureState.java:347)\n..\nat \norg.eclipse.birt.report.engine.api.ReportEngine.openReportDesign(ReportEngine.java:216)\n\non my code :IReportRunnable birtReport \u003d \nengine.openReportDesign(reportFile);",
