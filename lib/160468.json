    "The Junit test execution Continously gives this exception. Not able to run JUnits. Searching through the bug list found that \"149971\"  has also reported the same problem. The same problem is not reproduced on my other machines. Since replaced the entire eclipse set up with no use.Exception still happened . Bug 149971 did not describe how the problem has been fixed. Not sure abt the exact component selection ,but should be against agent controller. \n\n\n\neclipse.buildId\u003dM20060921-0945\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_12\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nCommand-line arguments:  -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -clean\n\nInfo\nWed Oct 11 18:11:05 IST 2006\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.DaemonConnectException\n\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.DaemonConnectException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl._connect(NodeImpl.java:225)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:360)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:347)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$4.run(TestExecutionHarness.java:2430)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\nCaused by: org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.ProcessImpl.getProcessId(ProcessImpl.java:497)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl._connect(NodeImpl.java:220)\n\t... 4 more",
    "Please add a test case for reproducing this problem.",
    "the test case would be in it simplest for ...\n1) Create test configuration for a test suite \n2) Run test configuration.\n\nAs is said this scenario is similar to the bug 149971, which also reports abt the same problem , and is seen there after continuously. Also i was not able to reproduce the same scenario on a different machine , though the entire eclipse set up is same on both the machine. This effectively rules out me giving a specific test case which is reproducible across . The only other option could be we setting up some meeting and giving access to my machine.",
    "Can you clarify the following?\n- Is the standalone New Technology Agent Controller or the Integrated Agent Controller being used?\n- Is it a local deployment Test scenario?\n",
    "One of our users have run into this situation before becuase there was not enough room for the deployment of the Junits.  You may want to try deleting the content of the deployment directory.  It seemed to fix the problem.\n\n\n",
    "Not containable in 4.3 and retargetting to 4.4 as per Oct 26 Platform\nCollection \u0026 Communication Meeting.  The bug is only producible on the reporters machine, and there is a suggested workaround that should be attempted first.\n\n",
    "Having investigated this bug, and consulting with Samson Wai as well as Joanna Kubasta, we have decided to close this bug as works for me since it cannot be reproduced.",
    "Updated target to match the iteration when this defect was processed"
