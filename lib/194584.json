    "Try to connect a dstore daemon connection to a remote host where the daemon is not running. The error message shown is:\n\n    Failed to connect to the daemon on PARSER using port 4075 with an \n    unexpected exception\n\nIt would be much more user friendly to see a mesage like this instead:\n\n    Failed to connect to the daemon on PARSER using port 4075. Please\n    check if the RSE dstore daemon is running on the remote host,\n    and the host is accessible through the network.\n\nPressing the \"Details\" button shows a traceback like the following; I think that at least in case of a \"ConnectException: Connection refused: connect\" this details exception should not be shown to the user, in favor of an improved error message as mentioned above.\n\nFor me, the Exception is:\njava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect\n\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketConnect(Native Method)\n\t[...]\n\tat org.eclipse.dstore.core.client.ClientConnection.connectDaemon(ClientConnection.java:739)\n\n\tat org.eclipse.dstore.core.client.ClientConnection.launchServer(ClientConnection.java:642)\n\n\tat org.eclipse.rse.connectorservice.dstore.DStoreConnectorService.launchServer(DStoreConnectorService.java:1206)\n\n\tat org.eclipse.rse.connectorservice.dstore.DStoreConnectorService.launchServer(DStoreConnectorService.java:1196)\n\n\tat org.eclipse.rse.connectorservice.dstore.DStoreConnectorService.internalConnect(DStoreConnectorService.java:621)",
