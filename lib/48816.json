    "I believe this is acutally a PDE problem. When you launch it is supposed to \nconstruct a configuration that tells the launched runtime where things are.  In \nthe absence of this information the runtime defaults to assuming a contiguous \ninstall and the behaviour you saw.",

    "*** Bug 48851 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "The two problems were addressed:\n1. When self-hosting with links, we were passing the URL of the linked \nworskpace plug-ins in the config.ini file.  This is bad because these plugins \nare technically empty.  Now, if a workspace plug-in is linked, we pass the  \nlocation of the external plugin it corresponds to.\n\n2. If org.eclipse.platform is in source form in the host workspace, then in \nthe runtime workbench, BootLoader.getInstallURL() returns the location where \nthe Main class is found.  In this case, it is the bin folder of the \norg.eclipse.platform project in your host workspace, which is obviously \nproblematic.\nNow, the config.ini file has a new key: osgi.installLocation.  \nWhen PDE creates the config.ini for the runtime workbench, the value of this \nkey is set to the location of the target platform, as is set on the target \nplatform preference page.  So no matter where the org.eclipse.platform plugin \nis, we always set the value of the key to the root of the product you are \ndeveloping for, which is what is expected."
