    "From using version 2.1, I just changed to Version: 3.0.0 Build id: 200406251208\n\nWith v3, I find that printing does not work for text editor, java editor or \napparently any editor.  The print window comes up and everthing looks ok. But I \nclick on PRINT, the printer runs and then spits out a blank page, with nothing \non it. (Confirmed Brother HL-1440 printer is working for my other application \nsoftware)\n\nWhat is up?\n\nMaybe I did conversion to 3.0 incorrectly?  I just pointed new eclipse to my \nold 2.1 workspace.  Note: all my projects are outside my workspace directory.",
    "Is there anything in the .log file?",
    "\u003e\u003eIs there anything in the .log file?\nNo.  I don\u0027t see anything about printing.  I tried printing a couple times and \nnothing shows in .metadata/.log\n\nEclipse application appears to print, without any visible errors.  Again, I get \nthe print response window and click on the Print button and Eclipse then prints \neither one or two blank pages.  \n\nFYI, I also upgraded to latest Windows 2000 service pack and still cannot print.\n",
    "PS: I have multiple workspaces, and I\u0027m still using Eclipse 2.1 on another \nworkspace.  Maybe there are common dll\u0027s in 2.1 that Eclipse 3 might \nerroniously be using.  (I have tried rebooting machine and launched version 3 \nonly, but still could not print)  Is there a windows registry entry pointing to \nwrong dll\u0027s? \n",
    "Upgraded to j2re1.4.2_05. Still only blank pages are output.\n",
    "Nick can you print from Win2k on Eclipse R3.0?",
    "If you open eclipse R3.0 on a new empty workspace, then create a new file (text\nor java) and print from an editor, does this work?",
    "I created a new shortcut that pointed to a new empty workspace. From this, I \nopened eclipse v3.0, created new project inside workspace and new project \noutside workspace.  And created java file and test file in each.  Java editor \nand text editor print out single blank page.\n",
    "I\u0027m using Suse Linux 9.1 and I have identical issues. I can\u0027t print anything \nwith verison 3.0.0. T ",
    "It works for me on Win2K.\n",
    "Re comment #8, printing is not currently supported on Linux.  See bug 24796.",
    "I\u0027d like to see if anyone on the SWT team has some investigative questions \nhere.  I don\u0027t think this is a UI bug since Nick has no problems on his \nmachine.",
    "I don\u0027t agree I don\u0027t think that is a problem about linux because there is a \nsimilar issue for Windows 200 o.s.. The same object that manages printer works \nwell under mozilla and the command kprinter --stdin works well in a terminal. \n  ",
    "The bug report says \"Cannot print anything\" on Windows 2000.  SSQ to confirm \nthat printing works in Eclipse 3.0 on Windows 2000.  If so, close as \nWORKSFORME or investigate further with James.  James, do other applications \nprint fine?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d13451)\ntest\n\nI can print from eclipse 3.0 on Win2k and WinXp without problems.\n\nJames, please could you run the attached test and see if it is working properly\non your machine? Thanks.",
    "Sorry for slow response.\n\u003e\u003e do other applications print fine?\nYes all my applications including Eclipse 2.1 print ok.  Eclipse 3 just prints \nout one or two blank pages.\n\n---------------------------\nIncluded ws\\win32\\swt.jar in classpath.  Ran PR69067 class and had fatal error:\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no swt-win32-3062 in java.library.path\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.System.loadLibrary(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.loadLibrary(Library.java:100)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.\u003cclinit\u003e(OS.java:18)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Device.init(Device.java:564)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.init(Display.java:1780)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Device.\u003cinit\u003e(Device.java:100)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.\u003cinit\u003e(Display.java:355)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.\u003cinit\u003e(Display.java:351)\n\tat PR69067.main(PR69067.java:10)\nException in thread \"main\" \n\n----------------------\nI added following parameter to \u0027VM arguments\u0027 in Run window.  \n   -Djava.library.path\u003dc:/java/eclipse/v3/eclipse/plugins\n      /org.eclipse.swt.win32_3.0.0/os/win32/x86\n\nNow the window pops up.  I clicked on print button and printer printed out page \nwith two strings output like below, in large font in upper left hand corner. \nNote that String1 and String3 did not print out.\n----------\nString0\n\nString2\n\n\n\n----------\n",
    "So it seems that the TextLayout drawing is falling somehow. TextLayout is \nimplemented using the Uniscribe API instead of GDI (GC.drawString()).\n\nFelipe, do you have any idea why this is falling?",
    "James, did the diagonal lines printed OK?",
    "\u003e\u003edid the diagonal lines printed OK?\nNo. The only things that printed was \u0027String0\u0027 and \u0027String2\u0027.\n\nMaybe this is pertinent.  I am using Spring plugin and it has dependency on \nGEF, so I have GEF plugin installed too.  This has something to do with \ngraphics so maybe it is conficting with swt stuff.\n\n",
    "I don\u0027t know what is going on, first time I see this problem.",
    "I am very sorry.  I went and looked at the print out again.  There is two very \nvery light thin lines--almost invisible--that cross at the center of the page \ndiagonally and extend to the corners of page.  With the room a bit dark last \nnight, I didn\u0027t see them before.",
    "I just found something interesting.  In \u0027Printing Preferences\u0027 window in \n\u0027Advanced\u0027 tab for my HL-1440 printer, I changed to high resolution \u00271200x600\u0027 \nand checked \u0027Improved gray printing\u0027.\n\nThen I printed a java file in java editor, of Eclipse 3.0.  And something \nprinted on page.  It was the light blue horizontal bar that highlights the \ncurrent line in the editor.  I repeat, all that printed was a light gray bar \nexactly where the highlighting bar had been in the editor.\n\nHope this helps your diagnosis.\n"
