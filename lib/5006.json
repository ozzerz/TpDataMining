    "DESRIPTION: \nThis was written against the Web Project, \nbut it is reproducable with a Java Project\n\n    \u003cNote by Customer Rep, 2001/10/02 18:21:03, seq: 1 rel: 0  action: open\u003e\nWhen you rename a web project from (select project-\u003eright click-\u003erename)\nfrom \"Webproj\" to \"WEBPROJ\". Notice that all we did was change the case \nnot the length of the project name. Doing this caused WSAD to display a \ndialog box saying that an internal error was encountered whenever we \naccessed files in the renamed project. I looked at the .log file and \nnoticed     \nthat the exception occured when WSAD tried to open         \nthe .properties files for the project.    \n\nLog: Tue Oct 02 17:53:14 EDT 2001\n4 org.eclipse.core.resources 272 Could not open indexed store: C:\\Program \nFiles\\IBM\\WebSphere Studio Application \nDeveloper\\workspace\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.core.resources\\.projects\\WEBP\nROJ\\.properties.\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.indexing.ObjectStore.commit(ObjectStore.java:183)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.indexing.ObjectStore.close(ObjectStore.java:168)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.indexing.IndexedStore.create(IndexedStore.java:151)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.indexing.IndexedStore.open(IndexedStore.java:314)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.properties.IndexedStoreWrapper.open(IndexedStoreWrappe\nr.java:138)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.properties.IndexedStoreWrapper.create(IndexedStoreWrap\nper.java:51)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.properties.IndexedStoreWrapper.getStore(IndexedStoreWr\napper.java:132)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.properties.IndexedStoreWrapper.getIndex(IndexedStoreWr\napper.java:97)\n       at \norg.eclipse.core.internal.properties.IndexedStoreWrapper.getCursor(IndexedStoreW\nrapper.java:88)                 \nAfter this, deleting a project fails with a NullPointerException during build. \nAlso, trying to rename any project \n(eg a java project) now results in the same error (this worked prior to \nrenaming \nthe web project).\nAlso, the workspace is messed up - here are a couple of examples:\n - When I create a project, the \u0027Create a Project\u0027 smartguide does\nnot close on completion, I have to hit cancel to get out of it. \n - File-\u003eNew-\u003eEnterprise Java Bean Sample does not load the sample\u0027s java code \nEventually, I need to reinstall to get WSAD to behave properly.\n\n\n    \u003cNote by developer, 2001/10/03 17:12:40, seq: 4 rel: 0  action: assign\u003e\nThis is a severe error with \"Navigator View\".  Though Java\u0027s \"Packages View\" \ndoes\nnot have this problem, it has a related problem.\n\nOverview:\n\nIf, in the \"Navigator View\", a resource is renamed so as the name is the same, \nexcept\nsome capitalization is changed (i.e. JavaProject is renamed to javaProject), \nerrors, \nexceptions, and worse problems occur.  The only scenario where this does not \noccur is\nin a \"Simple Project\" which has nothing in it.  Once you put something in a \nsimple \nproject (i.e. a file or folder), it too has the same problems.\n\nIn the worse case scenario, let\u0027s say you create a java project called \"Jp1\" \nand \nthen rename it to\n\"JP1\".  You will get errors and exceptions, but you may (I stress - MAY) also \nend up with two\nprojects - one called \"Jp1\" and one called \"JP1\" - the contents of each \npointing \nto the same files.\nIf you try to delete or close either project you will get various exceptions \nand \nerrors.\nIf you try to create another java project you will receive more errors and \nexceptions (regarding\nvalidation) - and will return to the wizard (but the project will have actually \nbeen created).\n\n\n\"Packages View\"\n\nPackages View doesn\u0027t have this problem, but it has one similar to it.  If you \ntry to rename a resource\nin this view to a name that already exists (except the capitalization is \ndifferent), you will get an \nexception.  Example: say you have two projects, one called \"javaproject\" and \none \ncalled \"javaProj\".\nIf you rename \"javaproject\" to javaproj you will get an exception.\n\n\nnote:  these rename problems occur not only with projects, but also with \nfiles/folders.",
