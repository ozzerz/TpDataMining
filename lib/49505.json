    "While writing RCP examples I keep getting a confusing error at run-time. I\u0027m \nrunning the application using a run-time workbench, and under the Plug-ins and \nFragments tab of the launch configuration I select Choose plug-ins and \nfragments to launch from the list. Then I list all the plug-ins that the \napplication needs. This is a royal pain to keep up because when I miss one I \nget a cryptic error in the .log file that the application could not be located \n(shown below). \n\nFirst of all, the list of required plug-ins should be maintained for me, but \neven if it\u0027s not, then the error message should tell the user which plug-in is \nmissing. It would be nice if the error were printed in the console by default, \ntoo, so the budding RCP application developer doesn\u0027t have to know about .log \nto start with.\n\n!SESSION Jan 04, 2004 16:30:51.558 --------------------------------------------\n-\njava.version\u003d1.4.1\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nCommand-line arguments: -pdelaunch -dev bin -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -nl \nen_US\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 13 Jan 04, 2004 16:30:51.558\n!MESSAGE Unable to locate application extension: \norg.eclipsepowered.rcptutorial3.RcpApplication\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to locate application extension: \norg.eclipsepowered.rcptutorial3.RcpApplication\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run\n(PlatformActivator.java:205)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run\n(EclipseStarter.java:85)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke\n(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:39)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke\n(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:25)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:324)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:279)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:742)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:581)",
    "It looks like this kind of error reporting was lost when we moved to the Equinox\nruntime. It used to create log entries like:\n\nplugin \"x\" could not be loaded because it is missing required plug-in \"y\".\n\nThese error messages no longer seem to appear. I agree that the resulting log\nentry is very cryptic.",
    "Ed, with regard to your comment about having to maintain the pre-reqs manually,\nI suggest you enter an enhancement request against PDE UI.  It feels like they\nshould be able to provide a fourth option in the \"plugins and fragments\" tab of\nthe launch configuration along the lines of \"Launch with all plug-ins required\nby this application\".  \n\nI have been doing some RCP application writing as well, and I feel your pain\nabout manually configuring this list. The approach I\u0027ve been using is to ensure\nthat every plug-in I need is in the workspace (as binary plug-ins for the ones\nI\u0027m not working on).  I then remove all external plugins from my target platform\n(prefs \u003e plugin development \u003e target platform \u003e Deselect all). Then I can \nalways use \"Launch with all workspace and enabled external plug-ins\" in the\nlaunch configuration. Most non-RCP developers just launch with all internal and\nexternal plug-ins enabled, but in the RCP case you want to test against a\nlimited configuration.",
    "Agree wholeheartedly about the error logging.  The current behaviour is \ncharacteristic of us implementing a new resolver (rather than the move to OSGi \nper se).   We had a bug related to this but cannot find it now.  The basic idea \nis that we are/will be able to produce a state summary that includes details \nabout any resolution issues.  There is alot more potential here than in the \nprevious story we have just not tapped it.  \n\nRe maintaining the list of prereqs, this is a PDE issue as John mentioned.\n",
    "Ok, two PDE UI issues have been entered: see bug 49591 and bug 49592.",
    "Yup, this is one of the nastiest problem to debug. Just spent almost a day for\nthis thing until I get to this bug.\n\nHopefully, the \u003ca href\u003d\"https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d40545\"\u003enew\nfeature\u003c/a\u003e scheduled for M7 would help a little bit. I haven\u0027t got a chance to\ntry it out though.\n",
    "Fixed as a consequence of bug 50168 being fixed.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 50168 ***"
