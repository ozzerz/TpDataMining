    "Problematic version is swt-3.1.1-win32-wce_ppc-arm-j2se.zip v3.139. The error which I started investigating was an UnsatisfiedLinkError for org/eclipse/swt/internal/win32/OS.GetWindowOrgEx. Although it\u0027s GetWindowOrgEx which gives the error in this case[1], a comparison of the native methods defined by org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS and those actually present in swt-win32-3139.dll shows that there are a lot of missing native methods.\n\nTo compare:\n\n$ javah -classpath swt.jar org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS\n$ grep JNIEXPORT org_eclipse_swt_internal_win32_OS.h | sed \"s/JNIEXPORT [a-z]* JNICALL //\" | sort \u003e/tmp/requiredNativeMethods\n$ strings swt-win32-3139.dll | grep \"Java_org_eclipse_swt_internal_win32_OS_\" | sort \u003e/tmp/definedNativeMethods\n$ diff /tmp/requiredNativeMethods /tmp/definedNativeMethods\n$ diff /tmp/requiredNativeMethods /tmp/definedNativeMethods | grep \"\u003c\" | wc\n    295     590   22002\n$ diff /tmp/requiredNativeMethods /tmp/definedNativeMethods | grep \"\u003e\" | wc\n      0       0       0\n\n\n[1] Stack trace:\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: org/eclipse/swt/internal/win32/OS.GetWindowOrgEx(ILorg/eclipse/swt/internal/win32/POINT;)Z\n        at org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.setClipping(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.setClipping(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.BBGraphics.setGCClip(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.BBGraphics$SharedGC.grabGC(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.BBGraphics.setClip(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.BBGraphics.clipRect(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.Component.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.Window.dispatchEventImpl(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.Component.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue.dispatchEvent(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue.eventLoop(Unknown Source)\n        at java.awt.EventQueue$EventDispatchThread.run(Unknown Source)\n\nTo explain, I\u0027m trying to update the version of SWT used by IBM\u0027s J9 (WEME) to implement AWT.",
    "Looks like we are missing some IsWinCE tests.  FH to investigate.",
    "not all org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS natives are present in the win-ce version of swt. See os.h section of /* Functions excludes */ and /* Structs excludes */. \nThat we need to do is make ensure these exclude natives never get called in win-ce.",
