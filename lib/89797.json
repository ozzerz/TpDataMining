    "This doesn\u0027t appear to have anything to do with connectivity. Was this just \nafter startup? The NPE is happening because the editor input is null. I wonder \nif the quick diff is happening before the editor has been restored.",
    "Upon further investigation, it can\u0027t be an unrestored editor. We check to make \nsure that the editor has an editor input when the editor for the quick diff \nprovider is set. Somehow, at a later point, the editor has no editor input. \nCould it have occurred during shutdown?",
    "I did make changes in this area (related to obtaining files from editor \ninputs). I\u0027ve changed the code to work as it did before (i.e. if there is no \neditor input, null is returned).",
    "What\u0027s the consequence of the NPE? Isn\u0027t this an M6 candidate?",
    "I don\u0027t know. Is this reproducable for you? Can you give me any information \nthat would help me reproduce it? Did you see any funtionality loss? If not, \nthen I don\u0027t see any reason to consider it for M6.",
    "On second thought, the fix is pretty safe. I\u0027ll put it in.",
    "I\u0027m pretty sure it happend while my connection got lost and it wasn\u0027t during a\nstart or shutdown scenario. What I saw when there was no connection was that the\nhistory view stayed empty but that\u0027s probably not related."
