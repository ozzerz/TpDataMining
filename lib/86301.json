    "3.1 M5a\n\nI could not run JUnit plug-in tests when targetting 2.1.3. I would always get\nthe following error, regardless I chose the \"special\" headless application or\norg.eclipse.ui.workbench. Using M4, it worked.\n\n!SESSION ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Feb 23, 2005 11:42:29.280\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Application not found:\norg.eclipse.pde.junit.runtime.legacyCoretestapplication.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.run(InternalBootLoader.java:856)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader.run(BootLoader.java:461)\n    ...\n\n\nDebugging, I noticed that only two applications were contributed by\norg.eclipse.pde.junit.runtime. The \"legacy\" applications were not. The reason is\n awrong markup used in the plugin.xml for org.eclipse.pde.junit.runtime that\nresults in a valid plugin.xml (so the problem went undetected): the second\nextension to the application extension actually contains the two other extension\nelements.\n\nAs a side note, even after I fixed the problem above in my install, I could not\nfigure out how to run a 2.1.3 JUnit plug-in test in UI mode. It would always use\nlegacyCoretestapplication.",

    "that\u0027s one copy-and-paste job gone bad.\nFixed.  \n\nRunning 2.1.3 UI tests is also fine.  I just verified by running the JDT/UI \ntests.\nThe only know issue with 2.1.x Plugin JUnit testing is that the runtime window \nmight have to be closed manually at the end of the test run.  This is because \nthe 2.1.x UI code does not notify PDE when the tests are all run, so PDE uses \na best guess, which is not accurate sometimes.  However, since Eclipse 2.1.x \ndid not have Plugin JUnit testing anyway, even the ability to run 2.x Plugin \nJunit tests is a luxury courtesy of your PDE team ;-)\n"
