    "Every time I\u0027ve tried Eclipse on my Mac (Jaguar) it has failed to start. The problem seems \nto be the launcher. I\u0027ve made my own launcher (using MRJAppBuilder + coding by \nhand), included as an attachment.",

However, Apple\u0027s recommends to stop using \nMRJApp.properties because they cannot deal with spaces in path names.",
