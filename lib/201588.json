    "Build ID: eclipse.buildId\u003dI20070625-1500\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1.Open help -\u003e software updates -\u003e find and install\n2. make an archive site with cdt-master-4.0.1-I200708290101.zip\n3. xlC feature is missing.\n\nsame is true of yesterday\u0027s.\nIt worked on cdt-master-4.0.0-I200706261300.zip\n\n\nMore information:\nDoug says it\u0027s physically there.\n\nError log reports:\njava.io.FileNotFoundException: JAR entry features/org.eclipse.cdt.xlc.feature_4.0.1.200708290101.jar not found in C:\\download\\eclipse\\cdt-master-4.0.1-I200708290101.zip\n\tat sun.net.www.protocol.jar.JarURLConnection.connect(Unknown Source)\n\nAha. it\u0027s looking for 4.0.1 file and the file that\u0027s in the zip is 4.0.0.   Where is that specified?",
    "D\u0027oh. The site.xml file that gets generated assumes all the features have the same buildVersion. That won\u0027t be generally true, or maybe it should. I\u0027m not sure.\n\nThere two solutions, 1) hard code the version number for the features that are different and pass in the timestamp to complete the buildversion attribute for it, or 2) up version the xlc feature to 4.0.1.\n\nAny preferences?",

    "Damn... even though the plug-ins were upversioned I forgot to upversion the feature.  It\u0027s still not in the build :-(\n\nWhere is that clown nose...\n\nAnyway, this should be FIXED in theory now, but we\u0027ll need a new build before it shows up.",
    "Forgot to set the target milestone...\n\nSetting this to 4.0.1 and asking Doug for a respin..."
