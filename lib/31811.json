    "From EC,\n\nI am compiling the output of a JavaCC generated parser from a complex\ngrammar.\nOne of the methods in the token manager contains a number of pretty large\nswitch statelements.\n\nIf I compile the code using the eclipse compiler the resulting app fails\nwith a Verify errror:\n\njava.lang.VerifyError: (class: XScriptParserTokenManager, method:\njjMoveNfa_0 signature: (II)I) Illegal target of jump or branch\nat XScriptParser.\u003cinit\u003e(XScriptParser.java:3956)\nat XScriptParser.main(XScriptParser.java:64)\nException in thread \"main\"\n\nThe same code compiled with the SUN javac from j2sdk1.4.1_01 works as\nexpected\n\nThe build used is M5.",
    "Can we get a testcase reproducing the problem ? Did it work with M3 or M4 ?",
    "Cannot tag for 2.1 unless we get some reproduceable testcase.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d3489)\nGenerated file causing verify error\n\nMethod causing the error appears to be jjMoveNfa_0",
    "Could you please attach all the necessary files to compile this code?\nSimpleCharStream, the implemented interface.\nThanks. It will allow me to investigate more quickly.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d3494)\nCompilable subset of files including XScriptParserTokenManager\n\nNote the XScriptParserTokenManager is not the same as the original, as I have\nbeen working on it today, however the one in the zip file still exhibits the\nsame error, so please take all of the files as a new whole. I have checked them\nout in a new project and get no compile messages.",
    "Problem reproduced. I am investigating.",
    "I am testing a fix right now. Thanks for the test case and the bug report. This\nwasn\u0027t a new bug. We have it since day 1.\nI will add regression tests.\n",
    "Fixed and released in 2.1 stream.\nRegression test added.",
    "Verified."
