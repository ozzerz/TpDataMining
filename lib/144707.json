    "I have a self-hosted environment so that I can test running with proper features.  Everything has worked up until today for some reason.  I cannot set up a simple pserver-based CVS repository.  Any fetch operation results in an exception like the following:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2006-05-31 11:55:38.050\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Fetching children of HEAD\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/jcraft/jsch/ProxyHTTP\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.PServerConnectionMethod.createConnection(PServerConnectionMethod.java:21)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSRepositoryLocation.createConnection(CVSRepositoryLocation.java:538)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSRepositoryLocation.openConnection(CVSRepositoryLocation.java:780)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.client.Session.open(Session.java:159)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performUpdate(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:97)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation$InternalRemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performUpdate(FetchMembersOperation.java:69)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:64)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:55)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation.execute(FetchMembersOperation.java:107)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.CVSOperation.run(CVSOperation.java:81)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.model.CVSTagElement.fetchDeferredChildren(CVSTagElement.java:136)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.progress.DeferredTreeContentManager$1.run(DeferredTreeContentManager.java:207)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.jobs 4 2 2006-05-31 11:59:37.546\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Fetching children of HEAD\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/jcraft/jsch/ProxyHTTP\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.PServerConnectionMethod.createConnection(PServerConnectionMethod.java:21)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSRepositoryLocation.createConnection(CVSRepositoryLocation.java:538)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSRepositoryLocation.openConnection(CVSRepositoryLocation.java:780)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.client.Session.open(Session.java:159)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performUpdate(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:97)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation$InternalRemoteFolderMemberFetcher.performUpdate(FetchMembersOperation.java:69)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:64)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.resources.RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.fetchMembers(RemoteFolderMemberFetcher.java:55)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.FetchMembersOperation.execute(FetchMembersOperation.java:107)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.operations.CVSOperation.run(CVSOperation.java:81)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.model.CVSTagElement.fetchDeferredChildren(CVSTagElement.java:136)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.progress.DeferredTreeContentManager$1.run(DeferredTreeContentManager.java:207)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\n\nMy workspace contains a source version of the com.jcraft.jsch plugin in it, and I have the org.eclipse.platform and org.eclipse.rcp features imported.  My launch configuration is set to \"Use features in the workspace (simulated normal startup)\", and there are no validation issues with my plugins.\n\nI have never had issues self-hosting before and I have been doing this consistently for various Eclipse releases over the last year and a half or so.\n\nThe only thing I have changed recently was I upgraded my development environment from 3.2RC4 to 3.2RC5 (now I see RC6 is now available).  Did something fundamental change between those releases?\n\nI am using Eclipse 3.2RC5.",
    "Why do you have the Jsch client as source? Does removing it fix the problem? The problem could be related to a mismatch between the Manifest of the plugin that ships with RC5 and the Manifest in your workspace.",
    "Well, I have the plugin imported into my workspace because that is required for Feature-based self-hosting.  When I upgraded to RC5 I cleared my workspace and re-imported all of the required Eclipse plugins from scratch.  I import them as source just because I like to be able to debug things...\n\nSo, to answer your question - deleting it does not work because it then breaks all my dependencies for self-hosting and I can\u0027t launch a runtime workbench.  (It informs me that org.eclipse.team.cvs.core, org.eclipse.team.cvs.ssh, org.eclipse.team.cvs.ssh2, org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui will all be disabled due to org.jcraft.jsch missing).  \n\nI tried deleting it and re-importing the plugin again as a source project and it failed with the same error.  Then for kicks I decided to delete it again from my workspace and re-import it as a binary project and it worked!?  Deleting and re-importing again as a source project and it fails again.  Weird... why would that be?\n\nI usually import all of my Eclipse plugins as source projects just because I can.  Is there a reason not to do this when you are self-hosting, or is this some sort of bug in the PDE or perhaps in the way org.jcraft.jsch is packaged?\n",
    "The problem is that Jsch does not ship with the source. You will either need to obtain the source from JCraft.com or import the project as a binary project.",
    "OK, thanks Michael."
