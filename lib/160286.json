    "The NPE is caused by bringing up the context menu on an empty selection under certain cirmcumstances. Fixing that revealed that profiles were being deleted in the model, but not on disk. Fixed that as well -- added methods to delete profiles by name and adjusted a method to include the ability to persist a deletion of a profile.",

    "Looking at the exception, it seems that when the error occured, fewer RSE plugins were loaded than when Dave tried to reproduce it. \n\nThe Platform AdapterManager only returns adapters when the corresponding AdapterFactory is already known (and the plugin which contributes the adapter factory is started). We should check plugin dependencies, what adapter is needed and where it is provided.\n\nA solution with contributing adapter factory through plugin.xml, and using Platform.getAdapterManager.loadAdapter() could perhaps be used similar to what we are doing in org.eclipse.rse.subsystems.files.core/Activator, with the adapters registered in org.eclipse.rse.files.ui.",
