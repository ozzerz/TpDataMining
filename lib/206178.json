    "If an error in ApplicationActionBarAdivosor-class occurs the application is just terminated, but does not throw an exception on console, even not in debug mode. Example: Save Action. \nWhen the save action is not created in the RCP\u0027s ActionBarAdvisor, but tried to be registered the application is just terminated. \nA possible solution might be: \n\n protected void register(IAction action) {\n    \ttry{\n        String id \u003d action.getId();\n//        Assert.isNotNull(id, \"Action must not have null id\"); //$NON-NLS-1$\n        getActionBarConfigurer().registerGlobalAction(action);\n        actions.put(id, action);\n    \t}\n    \tcatch(NullPointerException e){\n\t\t\tString message \u003d \"The to registered action element pointed to null.\"; //$NON-NLS-1$\n\t\t\tWorkbenchPlugin.log(new Status(IStatus.ERROR, String.valueOf(WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault().getBundle().getBundleId()), message,e ));\n\t\t}\n    }",
    "I seem to be getting things in my console if I do something like register(null) in my ApplicationActionBarAdvisor\u0027s makeActions(IWorkbenchWindow) method on I20071009-2225.\n\nAlso, is 206179 essentially a duplicate of this?",
    "thanks for your quick reply! :)\n\nI don\u0027t get anything on my console, but something useful is logged. \nNevertheless I think my proposal is: \n\na.more descriptive to find out what was the cause \n\n1.(my suggeston\u0027s log):\n!ENTRY 22 4 0 2007-10-13 11:53:57.093\n!MESSAGE The to registered action element pointed to null.\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.application.ActionBarAdvisor.register(ActionBarAdvisor.java:190)\n\tat testsnady.ApplicationActionBarAdvisor.makeActions(ApplicationActionBarAdvisor.java:24)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.application.ActionBarAdvisor.fillActionBars(ActionBarAdvisor.java:148)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow.fillActionBars(WorkbenchWindow.java:3301)\n\t...\n\ncomparted to:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 0 2007-10-13 11:57:02.640\n!MESSAGE Unhandled event loop exception\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.application.ActionBarAdvisor.register(ActionBarAdvisor.java:188)\n\tat testsnady.ApplicationActionBarAdvisor.makeActions(ApplicationActionBarAdvisor.java:24)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.application.ActionBarAdvisor.fillActionBars(ActionBarAdvisor.java:147)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow.fillActionBars(WorkbenchWindow.java:3301)\n\t \n\nb. and further more essential the application is not terminated, only because an action item could not be registerd. Maybe referring to this different opinions exists, but in my opinion that application should only be terminated if an error message is printed to the console. \n\nConcerning 206179 I I\u0027ll comment soon, again. ",
    "(In reply to comment #2)\n\u003e I don\u0027t get anything on my console, but something useful is logged.\n\nSorry, I don\u0027t understand. Your Eclipse console has nothing but you have things in your target runtime workspace\u0027s logs?",
    "\u003e Sorry, I don\u0027t understand. Your Eclipse console has nothing but you have things in your target runtime workspace\u0027s logs?\nExactly. Any idea?\n\nCan you please comment \u0027b.\u0027, too. ",
    "(In reply to comment #4)\n\u003e \u003e Sorry, I don\u0027t understand. Your Eclipse console has nothing but you have things in your target runtime workspace\u0027s logs?\n\u003e Exactly. Any idea?\n\nWell, as I mentioned, I have stuff in my logs.\n\n\u003e Can you please comment \u0027b.\u0027, too.\n\nIf an application terminates and errors are logged, I feel it\u0027s perfectly valid for it to terminate. I do not feel that it\u0027s necessary to spit output onto the console. Log files are there for a reason. Perhaps someone from the Platform team can comment on this, but this is just my own opinion.",
    "First of all thanks for your replies. \n\nIn general I agree with you concerning the logging, but referring to the high learning curve for getting familiar with eclipse (plug-in development /) RCP I thought for beginners this might be better. \n\nSo, I keep up to you what is the better way concerning the reported bugs/enhancements!",
    "Can you provide your build ID (Help -\u003e About Eclipse SDK)? Also, can you provide the exact steps to reproduce the behaviour in question? If my application crashes because of an NPE, as far as I can remember, I\u0027ve always had something in my console even if it is not a full stack trace. So the fact that you have nothing in your logs interests me.",
    "1) Eclipse SDK, Version: 3.3.1, Build id: M20070921-1145. \n\n2) Sorry, if I didn\u0027t express myself good, but I do get the NPEs in the \u0027.log\u0027-file. I only get neither sth on \u0027console view\u0027 nor on \u0027cmd line console\u0027. \n\n3) The procedure is the same as yours, just try to register \u0027null\u0027 or rather an IAction field which references \u0027null\u0027. Concerning 206179 the procedure is alrieady delivered in the description. ",
    "If you put print statements before you cause your NPE, does it appear in the console?",
    "Yes, they appear in the console.\n\n",
    "If someone wants to submit a patch I\u0027ll consider it.\n\nappropriate is check for null and throw an IllegalArgumentException\n\nPW\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d81267)\nPatch to check if the IAction is null.\n\n"
