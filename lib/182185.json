    "build i0410\n\nI was trying to reproduce the problem in bug 160290 (they have bundles in their target without version numbers in the filenames) so I took an Eclipse install and removed the version numbers from the filenames. But when I tried to start this build, I got an error saying that the executable could not find its companion shared library.\n\nRenaming the equinox.launcher bundle and fragment to include a \"_1\" at the end resulted in a crash (will attach dialog) with no error log.\n\nNote how some of the command-line args are duplicated in the dialog. Is this intentional? Also I swear there was a reference to startup.jar in the first dialog I got but I don\u0027t see it there in the later ones.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d63638)\nerror dialog\n\n",
    "After the rename, I got the following in the log file before it gave me the above dialog.\n\n!SESSION Thu Apr 12 13:47:08 EDT 2007 ------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.equinox.launcher 4 0 2007-04-12 13:47:08.613\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not find framework\n\tat org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:782)\n\tat org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:403)\n\tat org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:1139)\n\tat org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:1114)\n\n",
