    "As part of product customization the splash screen was changed from the default\nto one provided by our feature. This works fine on Windows, but the splash\nscreen does not show on Mac OS X. The following is found in the error log.\n\nError Jul 18, 2004 13:13:35.499 Exception running command: c:\\Program\nFiles\\RichPalette\\He3\\eclipse -showsplash 600\njava.io.IOException: CreateProcess: \"c:\\Program Files\\RichPalette\\He3\\eclipse\"\n-showsplash 600 \"C:\\Program\nFiles\\RichPalette\\He3\\plugins\\com.richpalette.he3_0.7.0\\splash.bmp\" error\u003d2\nat java.lang.Win32Process.create(Native Method)\nat java.lang.Win32Process.\u003cinit\u003e(Unknown Source)\nat java.lang.Runtime.execInternal(Native Method)\nat java.lang.Runtime.exec(Unknown Source)\nat java.lang.Runtime.exec(Unknown Source)\nat java.lang.Runtime.exec(Unknown Source)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.runCommand(Main.java:1163)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.handleSplash(Main.java:1129)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:176)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:644)\nat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:628)\n\nThe fact that Win32Process is referenced in the stack trace is concerning.",
    "*** Bug 70305 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "And the use of a DOS path \nC:\\Program Files\\RichPalette\\He3\\plugins\\com.richpalette.he3_0.7.0\\splash.bmp\nmakes no sense either.\nAre you sure you are running on a Mac?\nIs this path hardcoded?",
    "Looks like I was a little to quick with this bug report. I am seeing a problem with changing the splash \nscreen on Mac OS X. However, the provided stack trace was incorrect. No stack trace is produced and \nno error is written to the log; the splash screen is simply not displayed.\n\nThe provided stack trace was created with VirtualPC on Mac OS X if that gives you any insight into the \nactual problem.",
    "Need to investigate for 3.0.1.\nMatt have you solved the issue?",
    "Pascal, Will this be fixed for 3.0.1 RC1?",
    "Unclear, I haven\u0027t investigated yet.",
    "Is there a list of steps required to change the splash screen on Mac OS X that I\ncould use to verify against? I was able to change the splash screeen on Windows\nand Linux using the provided instructions, but the same steps don\u0027t seem to work\non Mac OS X. I have tried several additional steps, but no luck so far.",
    "There is a document here:\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/docs/branding/BrandingYourApplication.html\n\nLet us know if you still have problems changing your splash screen.",
    "I did a quick test on our mac following the instructions, and it worked as expected.\nPlease re-open with details if you still have a problem."
