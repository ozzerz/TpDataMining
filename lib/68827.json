    "Please ensure that you have:\n- downloaded the SDK and not the RCP SDK. You can determine this by checking the\nnumber of plug-ins in your /eclipse/plugins directory. The RCP SDK will have\nonly 11 plug-ins. The RCP download is intended to be a framework and this is the\nerror that you will get if you try and run it without creating your own application.\n- make sure you uninstalled your old version of Eclipse or installed Eclipse 3.0\nto a different directory. (ensure you didn\u0027t extract 3.0 over-top of your old\ninstall) Installation instructions can be found at /eclipse/readme.\n\nIf check the above things and still get the same result, then please re-open\nthis report.\n",
    "All of us with this problem downloaded the SDK ( eclipse-SDK-3.0-win32.zip ).\nI have reverted back to RC3 because 3.0 will not even start up.",
    "Sorry. Premature reopen. I re-installed in a new directory. Then copied \nevertything that was not shipped with 3.0 into the new directory and it worked. \n\nThis has not been a required step in the past. Many of us have always installed \nbback to the same directory. As you would expect from most applications. \nEvidently doing so with 3.0 is a problem. Not sure what would cause that, but \nit might be a consideration for future upgrades."
