    "Build ID: M20070921-1145\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nI use Eclipse 3.3.1 with TPTP 4.4.0.3 on a Windows Server 2003 (Citrix). Agent Controller Version 4.4.0.0 runs on a SLES 9 Blade.\nThe problem is that I can\u0027t connect to the Agent Controller from eclipse. I perform the following steps.\n1. Open a project in eclipse with sources that are running on the linux blade.\n2. Rightclick on the project --\u003e Profile As --\u003e Open Profile Dialog\n3. Create a new configuration for \"Attach to Agent\"\n4. Then I add the linux blade as a new server with IP and port : 10006  --\u003e Test connection is succesful\n5. Afterwards I try to get the available agents. After clicking \"refresh\" eclipse searches but instead of showing the agent it gives the following message: \"Error retrieving running agents - see log for more details\"\n6. The log shows the following information: \n!ENTRY org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui 4 4 2007-10-24 09:07:49.656\n!MESSAGE Error: Unable to connect to the Agent Controller.null\n!STACK 0\norg.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.exceptions.AgentControllerUnavailableException: Error: Unable to connect to the Agent Controller.null\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.client.core.internal.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:146)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.internal.launcher.AttachAgentTabProviders$DeferredAgentAdapter.fetchDeferredChildren(AttachAgentTabProviders.java:640)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.progress.DeferredTreeContentManager$1.run(DeferredTreeContentManager.java:196)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)\n7. After that action the Agent Controller is stopped and I have to restart it. \n\nMore information:",
    "Hi Sebastian,\nIt seems this is a bit mess.\nPlease try to configure in step 4. port 10002 for the remote Agent Controller.\nCurrently, both ports 10002 and 10006 are used internally for connection with AC and 10002 should be configured in workbench for profiling use.",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Hi Sebastian,\n\u003e It seems this is a bit mess.\n\u003e Please try to configure in step 4. port 10002 for the remote Agent Controller.\n\u003e Currently, both ports 10002 and 10006 are used internally for connection with\n\u003e AC and 10002 should be configured in workbench for profiling use.\n\u003e \nHi Igor,\n\nunfortunately doesn\u0027t work it. If I try with port 10002 instead of 10006 the test connection works fine but the connection could not be established. I click refresh, \"Pending\" is diplayed for a short time but disappears very quickly and nothing happens. Even the error message isn\u0027t on the screen.\n",
    "Hi Sebastian, \n\nThe \"Attach to Agent\" mode assumes that you have external application with an agent connected to Agent Controller.\nThis view shows all agents registered by AC.\nTo use this mode you can start your application in command line with profiling options.\n\nIf you intend to profile code in the current eclipse workspace you can use \"Java Application\" mode instead of.\n",
    "Ok perhaps I did a basic mistake, so I describe what I want to do.\nI have a java application that is running on BEA WLS. This WLS runs on the SLES9 blade. The agent controller is installed on the same blade. Eclipse is started on windows and from there i want to profile the java application that is running on the wls. Is it wrong to use \"Attach to Agent\"?",
    "I see :)\nIt seems you are right using attaching to agent.\nAre you starting application/wls with profiling options in enabled/controlled mode?",
    "Hi Bing. I have transferred my bugs to you for triage. Thanks.",
    "Thank you for your help. I had the wrong parameters for profiling options. Now everything works fine."
