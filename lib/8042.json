    "I got an internal notification error and a stack trace in my log while I was \nreading some java code.  I was not typing anything at the time.  I will attach \nthe file I was editing, but I don\u0027t know exactly where the mouse was hovering at \nthe time.  I was using the snippet editor, I had the class selected in the \ncontent outline, and I was reorganizing field declarations around the time it \nhappened.  Here is a snippet of the log, I will attach the rest:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException: \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.compiler.lookup.BaseTypeBinding\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.codeassist.select.SelectionOnMessageSend.resolveType(Se\nlectionOnMessageSend.java:45)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d239)\nLog file showing stack trace\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d240)\nThe java file that was being edited\n",
    "After much playing around I have a reproducible case.  Hover over the \"hello\" \nmethod call in this example:\n\npublic class A {\n\tboolean foo;\n\tpublic int boo() {\n\t\tfoo.hello();\n\t}\n}",
    "find method only if receiver type is a ReferenceBinding\n\nFixed"
