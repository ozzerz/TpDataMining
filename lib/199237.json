    "I really think this should be part of an enhancement request.  Supporting 1.6 is more than just fixing a defect.  It also has a huge impact in expanding our testing effort.  I hope we will evaluate dropping 1.4 at the same time we begin supporting 1.6.\n\nI agree that 4.5 would be a good release for this, as we are barraged by message board posts from people who fail using 1.6.  The demand is there, but we need to either get more staffing, drop other work, or drop another environment in order to support this.  Paul -- can you raise this with the PMC?\n\nThe sizing I\u0027m adding is completely wet-finger-in-the-wind.  It may go up or down once I\u0027ve had a chance to investigate why we\u0027re failing.",

    "I was able to execute JUnit and URL tests with no issues with both the AC and the IAC using the latest pre-release 1.6 IBM JVM that I found on Windows XP with the 4.4.0.3 TPTP driver.\n\nPerhaps there was an issue that has been resolved in the AC since the 4.4.0.1 driver or there were changes in the JVM.  I am using the JVM dated Aug 19, 2007.",
