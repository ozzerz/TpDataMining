    "The patch needs to be reviewed by committers before it can be applied. Since \nthe patch is of a significant size, the review will take some time (it could \ntake a few weeks in order to free up the resources to review it).",
    "A workaround for debugging J9 2.3 is to add -debug:server\u003dy to the VM args and \nlaunch J9 normally (using the normal Java Application, Eclipse Application \netc. launchers).  Then you can use the Remote java Application launcher to \nconnect to J9.",

    "Is there any progress on launching debug sessions with j9 2.3?  J9 2.3 will be going to customers soon and the workaround leaves a less-than-ideal impression for customers of j9.",
    "There are no special plug-ins in the SDK for J9 launching - it works with standard command line options with the standard VM launcher. The j9 launching plug-in in the repository can be used for launching J9, but it is not part of the SDK.",
    "The problem I referenced here is that debug sessions can only be launched IF jclFoundation10 profile exists.  I will open a new defect for this problem.",
    "I found another bug on the Windows platform (Eclipse 3.2):\n\nThe line J9VMRunner.java:625:\nprogram.append(\"j9w.exe\"); //$NON-NLS-1$\nmust be changed to\nprogram.append(\"j9.exe\"); //$NON-NLS-1$\n\nOtherwise the j9version will always be 2.2 (the default value)\nThis lead to bug mentioned by Berthold Lebert in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d106683#c13.\n\nDebugging regular Java application now works fine.\nBUT I am still not able to debug JUnit sessions. \nThe system hangs after j9dbgserv was started. \n\nAnd, if I add an break point I get the following error message:\n\"Unable to install breakpoint in pckg.Test due to missing line number attributes.
