    "The AJDT 1.4.0 seems a little unstable. Quite often I get a message \"Problems occurred when trying to refresh the selected resources.\" when trying to refresh a project.

    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\n\u003e I\u0027m not sure why a refresh would fail like that. Is it repeatable? \n \n  Yes, it happens so often that this version of ajdt is unusable. \n\n\n\u003e What is the underlying filesystem? \n\n  I\u0027m on local disc of a win xp box so I would suppose it\u0027s ntfs. I\u0027m currently on holiday, but I can check it when I use my work computer the next time. \n  I\u0027d like to stress that I have had no problem like this w/ the previous version of ajdt on eclipse 3.1.2\n\n\n\u003e Are you using linked source folders?\n\n  I\u0027m not aware of such a feature so I\u0027d say I\u0027m not. I think I had defined dependencies to the bin (where the .class files go) folders of other projects (i.e. added them to the build path). I can check this if this is significant.\n\n\n",
    "Thanks for the information.\nI\u0027ve looked through the stack trace in more detail, and the code definitely believes your project is a linked resource, which is a resource outside of the workspace. It is possible to create linked folders within a project, but in this case it appears that the whole project is outside of the workspace. This can happen when you choose \"create project from existing source\" in the new project wizard - did you do that? If so, could you try creating a new project in the workspace, and copying the source across? I still don\u0027t know why refreshing a project with an external location would fail like this, but at least if local projects work ok, you have a workaround. As another test, could you try creating a new simple test project from existing source, to see if that fails also.",
    "please reopen when you have time to respond to the above. thanks",
    "(In reply to comment #3)\n\nSorry it took me a while to answer - like I said I was on holiday.\n\n\u003e I\u0027ve looked through the stack trace in more detail, and the code definitely\n\u003e believes your project is a linked resource, which is a resource outside of the\n\u003e workspace. It is possible to create linked folders within a project, but in\n\u003e this case it appears that the whole project is outside of the workspace. This\n\u003e can happen when you choose \"create project from existing source\" in the new\n\u003e project wizard - did you do that? \n\n  Yes, the sources for my projects live outside the workspace, and I used the \"create project from existing source\" to create them. This is due to us using several programming languages and the java sources being in a certain place in the whole source folder tree.\n\n\n\u003e If so, could you try creating a new project\n\u003e in the workspace, and copying the source across? \n\n  This seems to work ok.\n\n\n\u003e I still don\u0027t know why\n\u003e refreshing a project with an external location would fail like this, but at\n\u003e least if local projects work ok, you have a workaround. \n\n  Unfortunately the workaround is not usable. Our command line build requires the sources to be in a certain place, and I don\u0027t want to start hassling w/ two copies of the same sources. I guess I\u0027ll just wait till the version where this bug is fixed.\n  I also tried moving the workspace itself (File -\u003e Switch workspace), but Eclipse did not see my projects even though I set the workspace folder to be the folder containing the projects. Trying to import them caused an exception, so I gave up on that.\n\n\n\u003e As another test, could\n\u003e you try creating a new simple test project from existing source, to see if that\n\u003e fails also.\n\n  As my projects work when they are inside the workspace I don\u0027t think this is necessary. I can try it, though, if you need that info.\n\n\n\n\n",
    "I really can\u0027t see how this could be specific to the AspectJ builder. I was going to pass this over to Platform, but I see there\u0027s already an active bug for the same issue, so I\u0027m closing this as a duplicate.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 144499 ***"
