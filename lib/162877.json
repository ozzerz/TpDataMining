    "Hi\n\nI am trying to use to create the DataSource as in the example:\nhttp://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Dynamic_Table\n\nBut this occurring the following error:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat design.GeraArquivo.buildDataSource(GeraArquivo.java:167)\n\nThis is the code that I am using:\n164 public void buildDataSource() throws SemanticException {\n165 OdaDataSourceHandle dsHandle \u003d reportFactory.newOdaDataSource(\n166 \"Data Source\", \"org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc\");\n167 dsHandle.setProperty(\"odaDriverClass\", \"org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver\");\n\n...\n\n\nSomebody could help me?\n\nDebtor for the attention.",

    "I ran across this too and tried to debug it a little bit.  Here is what I posted to the BIRT newsgroup:\n\nHi,\n\nI was trying to run this example as well and I am using the code that is on the wiki (the standard oda driver class, not Firebird.)\n\nI\u0027ve been trying to debug this - I\u0027m new to BIRT so I apologize ahead of time if some of the below is obvious to folks, but if someone could explain what is happening to help me learn, I\u0027d be most appreciative.\n\nI\u0027m getting a NullPointerException at this line in the DECreateDynamicTable.java code;\n\ndsHandle \u003d designFactory.newOdaDataSource(\n                \"Data Source\", \"org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc\" );\n\nIt appears to me that in the newOdaDataSource method of org.eclipse.birt.report.model.api.ElementFactory.java\nthat this line of code is returning null;\n\nif ( ODAProviderFactory.getInstance( ).createODAProvider( null,\n                    extensionID ) \u003d\u003d null )\n\nfrom there it appears that the instance of ODAProviderFactory is being creataed, but the NullPointerException is occuring when the createODAProvider method is being called.\n\nThe createODAProvider method relies on the baseFactory variable, an IODAProviderFactory being initialized via the initeTheFactory method being called.\n\nThe only place I can see where this method is called is in org.eclipse.birt.report.model.plugin.ModelPlugin, and when I try to debug the program it never appears to be called.\n\nSo, if what I have said above is correct, what calls the ModelPlugin\u0027s start method, which is where the initeTheFactory method is called?\n\nAlso, if this is a bug I\u0027d be happy to log it in bugzilla, just let me know please.\n\nI\u0027m using BIRT 2.1.1.\n\nRegards,\n\nSusan \n\n",
    "I don\u0027t think this is a bug anymore.  It turns out I did not have the required libraries in my class path at runtime.  Jason W. helped me with this and I modified the instructions for the example here:\n\nhttp://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Dynamic_Table\n\nto include more details about which libraries are required.  The example runs successfully for me now using the default datasource.\n\n",
    "Moving this to a BIRT component.",
    "Hi Mauricio,\n\nI\u0027ve reassigned the bug to Model team, however it turns out that this bug is again reassigned by you to eclipse app team. Please do not change the bug component so that we can have proper person to handle it. \n\nThanks.\nLin",
    "Mauricio,\n\nDo you still have this problem? Looks this is a runtime environment problem. Please make sure BIRT_HOME is correct. Otherwise, you will get NPE.\n\nconfig.setProperty(\"BIRT_HOME\", \"C:/birt-runtime-2_1_1/birt-runtime-2_1_1/ReportEngine\");\n\nNeed to modified the 2nd parameter to runtime folder on your machine. BTW, BIRT 2.2 runtime is also OK. Just make sure the directory value is good.\n\nPlease let me know whether it works or not.\n",
    "I tried again, lowering again the Birt and starting the project of the beginning, and of this time, everything occurred perfectly, made only some modifications in the original.\n\nvoid buildDataSource(ElementFactory designFactory, \n                         ReportDesignHandle designHandle, String usuario, \n                         String senha, String base) {\n        try {\n            OdaDataSourceHandle dsHandle \u003d \n                designFactory.newOdaDataSource(\"Data Source\", \n                                               \"org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc\");\n            dsHandle.setProperty(\"odaDriverClass\", \n                                 \"org.firebirdsql.jdbc.FBDriver\");\n            dsHandle.setProperty(\"odaURL\", base);\n            dsHandle.setProperty(\"odaUser\", usuario);\n            dsHandle.setProperty(\"odaPassword\", senha);\n            dsHandle.setName(\"Data Source\");\n            designHandle.getDataSources().drop(0);\n            designHandle.getDataSources().add(dsHandle);\n        } catch (SemanticException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\nTanks!"
