    "Some of the problems to address in NewKeysPreferencePage\n\n1) Does not remeber show all commands check box\n2) needs category column\n3) could use description column\n4) needs to update sorting for at least name, category, and key\n\nThere needs to be some kind of \"When\" filtering ... i.e. debug generates many contexts but they aren\u0027t for keybindings.  We\u0027re not sure what form this would take.\n\nPW",
    "One more thing needs to be replaced:\nCurrent Description Label with Scrolled Text Box\n\nAli",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d60868)\nSorting is added to NewKeysPreferencePage\n\nIt saves the \"Show all\" check box upon closing. And Sorting is also working. I am working on adding a Category column and will replace the current description label.\n\nAli",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d61014)\nNewKeyPreferencePage v-02\n\nFollowing things added:\nSorting,\"Show All Checkbox\" saving, Category Column and a Text area for description with Scroll bars. We could review it on Friday morning and possibly release it for M6.\nAli",
    "Ali, I got a change to check out the patch, the behaviour looks good.\n\nWe need to make 2 modifications before we submit it.\n\n1) we\u0027ll use dialog settings instead of a preference to remember show all commands.  Use WorkbenchPlugin.getDefault().getDialogSettings(), and then create your own section for the new keys preference page.\n\n2) We should add sort by Category in the GroupBy:None case ... I thought it wouldn\u0027t matter, but it does.\n\nPW\n",

    "Ali, I get an NPE when I try and run this patch:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.keys.NewKeysPreferencePage.createTreeControls(NewKeysPreferencePage.java:1298)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.keys.NewKeysPreferencePage.createContents(NewKeysPreferencePage.java:941)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferencePage.createControl(PreferencePage.java:233)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferenceDialog.createPageControl(PreferenceDialog.java:1421)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferenceDialog$13.run(PreferenceDialog.java:1180)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.SafeRunner.run(SafeRunner.java:37)\n\nPlease have a look and update.  I think it has to do with the return values from getDialogSettings().  You should either always assume it\u0027s the workbench level and ask for the section, or always assume it\u0027s the section that you need.\n\nPW\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d62949)\nNPE fixed in this patch\n\nPaul,\n\nI fixed the NPE exception in this patch, try it out and let me know.\n\nAli",

    "Please either make sure the new Keys preference page is complete for M7, or remove the page again for 3.3. Currently, the page is unusable, and removing it now would save a lot of testing energy.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d64943)\nNewKeyPreferencePage v-05\n\nPaul,\n\nI didnt take the add/remove image columns out. There is a method selectTreeColumn(MouseEvent event), in NewKeysPreferencePage which supports the functionality of these two columns. For some reason event.x and event.y are not returning the right value. I will investigate it tomorrow morning and might be able to fix it. \nAll the other fixes are in this patch, including the bindingManager change.\n\nAli",

Perhaps it\u0027s a problem with the tree on windows.\n\nI\u0027d still prefer to remove them, as we have the Add and Remove buttons in the editor area at the bottom.\n\nPW\n",

    "5 things to work on:\n\n1) add When column to the view\n\n2) remove GroupBy combo\n\n3) use Tree sort direction API\n\n4) add filters for actionSet contexts and *.internal.* contexts from the Advanced button\n\n5) move the description box under the When combo box.\n\nPW\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d65081)\nNewKeyPreferencePage v-07\n\nPaul,\n\nI have added items 1-3 in this patch. I tried to stretch the filter text box all the way to left but I couldnt. Secondly I updated my code and it seems like the previous patch  (Add/remove icons removed) is not in head yet, so this patch also includes the last patch.\n\nAli\n",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d65134)\nNewKeyPreferencePage v-08\n\nPaul,\n\nHere is the filters code, it works perfect (as far as I tested it). I admit that Code is not pretty, I had to make those tags public so that I could access it from preferencePage and filtersDialog and some other little things. I will clean it up more tomorrow morning. \n\nAli\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d65137)\nkeys v09\n\nI\u0027ve changed the advanced dialog so that it doesn\u0027t need to deal with dialog settings, but it looks good with two cases:\n\n1) when we change the filters it blanks out the combo box, ignoring the tree selection\n\n2) What should we do if the user has a filtered context already selected for a keybinding?  We show it in the tree, but if selected we update its context to In Windows and if you save it we treat it like a deliberate change.\n\nWe should work these out tomorrow morning.\n\nPW\n",
    "Released some fixes into HEAD \u003e20070427 10:30\n\n1. \"Include Unbound Commands\"\n2. \"editing\" a system binding works as expected\n3. changing the filters leaves the combo When correct\n4. there is a label on the User keybinding column\n\nStill working on:\n5. don\u0027t have the tree jump back to the beginning on delete\n\nPW\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d65345)\nNewKeysPreferencePage v-10\n\nPaul,\nI fixed two bugs in this patch:\n1. Blanking out all fields(dataControls) after delete.\n2. Updating the tree after changing the whenCombo.\n\nAli",
