    "Build ID: I20070323-1616\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. Go to install new features and select europa\n2. choosed an mirror\n3. pick Java Development-\u003e Eclipse Java Development Tools 3.3.0.v2\n\ninstall reports failed with no extra debug info from command  line\n\n\nMore information:\nUsing a MacBook",
    "I\u0027ll try to reproduce.",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\nPerformed the following tests:\nTEST1\n- installed a base 3.3 M6 Eclipse\n- went to Help --\u003e Software Update --\u003e Find and Install --\u003e Search for new features\n- Selected Europa discovery site --\u003e Finish\n- Selected a mirror site\n- Expanded the Java Development in the installable features list\n\n--\u003e note: no Eclipse Java Development Tools in the list (to be attached screen shot), which sounds ok to me, as this feature is included in the base Eclipse I installed, hence can not be re-installed.\n\nSo, my guess is that this feature was disabled (this might be verified in the .log file), due to some to be determined problem.\nTo assert this, performed the following:\nTEST2\n- shutdown Eclipse,\n- moved the jdt feature from eclipse\\features\\ to another directory\n- moved the jdt.jar file from eclipse\\plugins\\ to another directory\n- re-started with the -clean option\n- when to Europa update site again, expanded the Java Development item\n\n--\u003e found that I now had a new installable feature (Java Development Tools 3.3.0.v2xxxx) - to be attached screen shot\n\n- selected this feature and clicked next to accept the license agreement, then finish to proceed with feature download\n- finished installation and re-started the workbench as requested\n\n--\u003e so, no problem here\n\nBUT:\nif you select the [Hungary] i-Logic mirror server on the Update Site Mirrors page, the download aborts with an error message \"Update Operation has failed\"\n--\u003e seems to be the bug at hand\n\nIf you open the error log view, you\u0027ll find the following details:\nUnable to retrieve remote reference \"http://eclipse.i-logic.hu//releases/europa/features/org.eclipse.jdt_3.3.0.v20070319-1800-7n7dEAWEgDfeRYHuyAaFTR.jar\".

    "(In reply to comment #5)\nRoy,\nwhen I opened bug 185041, I wanted to track 2 separate issues:\n- bug 185041: 403 forbidden access\n- this bug: Java Dev Tooling appearing in the europa installable features\n--\u003e this is not expected / standard situation, and I wanted this one to remain opened until we discovered the reason why the base eclipse JDT feature was disabled",
    "(In reply to comment #6)\n\u003e (In reply to comment #5)\n\u003e Roy,\n\u003e when I opened bug 185041, I wanted to track 2 separate issues:\n\nSorry about that.  I thought this was a dupe.\n\n",
    "(In reply to comment #7)\nNo pb.\nThanks",
    "(In reply to comment #8)\nMay the reporter of this bug please help us determine the reason his original Eclipse was altered (see my comments #1 and #6).\n- start his current Eclipse config against a brand new workspace, and attach resulting .log file to this bug, \nand / or\n- download and install a more recent build and try to reproduce the issue.\nThanks.\n",
    "(In reply to comment #9)\nClosing as invalid as the only way to reproduce the bug context is to corrupt\nbase Eclipse install.\nFeel free to re-open the bug in case you still are able to reproduce it after a new Eclipse installation.\n"
