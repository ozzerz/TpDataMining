    "Hi,\n\nPydev stores information about the project (such as the folders that will enter in the pythonpath -- that is similar to the classpath in java) as persistent properties in the project.\n\nThis works very well in Eclipse 3.1.x, yet in eclipse 3.2, I\u0027ve had a bug report that says this is not possible in 3.2, as there is a limitation to that field.\n\nSo, I would like to know if there is there any reason for this limit, and if so: 1. What is it specifically? \n2. What is the actual limit? (the error raised should say which limit was reached, as it gives me no clues about it) \n2. How should I overcome it?\n3. How to make a plugin backward-compatible with that restriction?\n\nThe error that was pointed was:\n\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Could not set property: org.python.pydev PROJECT_SOURCE_PATH. Value is too long. \nat org.eclipse.core.internal.properties.PropertyManager2.setProperty(PropertyManager2.java:154) \nat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.setPersistentProperty(Resource.java:1506) \nat org.python.pydev.plugin.nature.PythonPathNature.setProjectSourcePath(PythonPathNature.java:137) \nat org.python.pydev.plugin.nature.PythonPathNature.getProjectSourcePath(PythonPathNature.java:179) \nat org.python.pydev.ui.PyProjectProperties.doIt(PyProjectProperties.java:163) \nat org.python.pydev.ui.PyProjectProperties.performOk(PyProjectProperties.java:150)",
    "The limit is 2K. (see IResource#setPersistentProperty) John, perhaps this should be changed to say the absolute limit is 2K? (e.g. remove the \"i.e.\"?)\n\nIf it was me, I would store the value in a different manner, either in a separate file, preference, or figure out how to keep it in the persistent properties and still maintain the limit restriction.\n\nThen I would look for the value in the new location, and if it existed then use it. If not, then look for it in the old location, convert it, and then use it.\n\nIn the future, please use the newsgroup for asking questions and use Bugzilla for entering bugs against the SDK. \n\nThanks.\n",
    "To clarify, the spec has always stated the 2KB limit.  In the past, we didn\u0027t explicitly enforce this limit but properties of greater than 2KB would sometimes cause errors in the property storage mechanism.  It sounds like you were getting away with it in the past. In response to DJ\u0027s comment, I have clarified the javadoc to change \"should\" to \"must\" and removed the \"i.e.,\" to make it clear this is an explicit limit.",
    "Yeah, actually, I didn\u0027t intend to put big strings, but apparently, as it depends on input from the user, it might be bigger than that... maybe even 5k...\n\nIf I open a request for raising that limit, does it stand a chance of being approved?",
    "The persistent property mechanism isn\u0027t designed for storing large amounts of data.  As DJ suggested, using a separate file is one option (the file can be stored under .settings directory, and you could store then name of the file in a persistent property if you want)."
