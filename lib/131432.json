    "I wasn\u0027t sure if I should report a problem with a nightly, but given that eclipse-SDK-N20060310-0010-linux-gtk-x86_64 has the same issue, I thought that it may be useful. I tried the 32-bit version with a 32-bit vm and that did not exhibit the problem.\n\nThe 64 bit version with Sun\u0027s JDK 1.5.0_06 fails to start with a clean workspace. The error displayed is:\n\n\"An error has occurred. See the log file\n/home/ijuma82/workspace/.metadata/.log.\"\n\nThe top of the .log file has:\n\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: _pango_layout_set_auto_dir\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS._pango_layout_set_auto_dir(Native Method)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.gtk.OS.pango_layout_set_auto_dir(OS.java:9034)\n\nI\u0027m also attaching the full log.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d36092)\n.log file\n\n",
    "I tried running the N20060311-0010 build and it at least starts for me.  So the trigger seems to be a bit more complex than just starting eclipse.\n\nThat being said, the pango_layout_set_auto_dir native was added on March 7th, so it\u0027s very likely that the 64-bit library was not compiled until this week\u0027s integration build (March 11th).\n\nMarking report as WORKSFORME; if you see this fail with the latest integration build or later then please reopen this report, thanks.\n",
    "(In reply to comment #2)\n\u003e That being said, the pango_layout_set_auto_dir native was added on March 7th,\n\u003e so it\u0027s very likely that the 64-bit library was not compiled until this week\u0027s\n\u003e integration build (March 11th).\n\nI believe this theory to be correct. Just tried the eclipse-SDK-I20060314-1200-linux-gtk-x86_64 and it works fine (and I can confirm that the ctrl-space crasher is also fixed). Thanks."
