    "Build: Eclipse 3.1RC1\n\nI got the following during shutdown (I think).\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.refresh.win32.Win32Monitor.run(Win32Monitor.java:515)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:67)",
    "Tom, should it be possible for Platform.getBundle() to be returning null after a\nplugin has shutdown (but was previously running successfully)? From looking at\nthe implementation, this should only happen if the bundle is in the INSTALLED or\nUNINSTALLED states.\n\nWe should add a null check here regardless, since Plaform.getBundle(...)\nspecifies that it may return null.  CCing DJ for approval of adding null check.",
    "+1\n",
    "When the framework is shutdown all bundle states are set to INSTALLED because \nwe have thrown away all the classloaders and the RESOLVED state of all the \nbundles.  This would cause null to be returned here.\n\nIt looks like a job thread was still active after the framework has shutdown.  \nIs that possible John?",
    "Yes, the job is canceled on shutdown, and the job checks for cancelation fairly\noften, but there is a timing hole if the job is running as resources shuts down\nand has not yet checked for cancelation. I will add the null check for RC2.",
    "Fix released (simple null check)"
