    "I was able to run the same test using a standalone installation of AC",
    "\nWith IAC, the local file manager is used rather than the FSS (file system services) subsystem I wrote.\n\nTherefore the issue is either coming from the local file manager or the Java test deployment adapter code.  Reassigning to Joe Toomey to make the call on who should get it (Samson for the file manager local or himself for the test parts).\n\nAlso, it might be worthwhile in the future to use FSS for all use cases and not have a special implementation for the local version.  FSS works locally and can be started on its own local port.",
    "Scott,\n\nI don\u0027t think you re-assigned it to Joe.\nLet me give it a try",
    "This is Samson\u0027s IAC fle transfer code.  If it works properly with the full AC (using FSS), then it\u0027s another opportunity to question why we have two substantial bodies of code doing the same thing.  If the AC\u0027s FSS needs further refactoring to incorporate it into the IAC, then feel free to file a defect for the changes you require.",

Samson, please come and see so that I can show you which machine I\u0027m able to reproduce this problem on.\n\nThanks.",
    "I confirmed with Samson that this was a JRE issue.  Using an updated JRE resolved the problem.\n\nThanks Samson for investigating this.",
