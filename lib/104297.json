    "I have a web project for which certain objects are provided by a separate\nproject. By identifying the separate project as required, the web project\nbuilds, but does not deploy because the exported binaries for the required\nproject are not included in the deployment.\n\nCertainly, there are workarounds, such as adding a custom builder to move it\nover, but that kind of defeats the point of having a required project.",
    "Hi Can you elaborate?   What do you mean by deployment?\n\nSo you have a module depencency setup (Using the project property sheet)\nAnd then you publish the war....   are you saying the server isn\u0027t finding the dep\nclasses?   or is it missing from the .deployables folder?",
    "I have a dependency listed in the project property sheet for another Java\nproject. When I publish the war, the server cannot find the dep classes, and\nthey are not in the .deployables folder.\n",
    "Hi Nash,\n  I have used scenario as you mentioned, and put my classes in  the project \ncalled Util, then from the Web project-\u003eProperties-\u003eJava Jar dependency-\u003eSet \nWeb library project dependency chose the Util  project, this\nadds following entry in  the .wtpmodules for the Web component.\n      \n\n  \u003cdependent-module deploy-path\u003d\"/WEB-INF/lib\" \nhandle\u003d\"module:/resource/Util/Util\"\u003e\n            \u003cdependency-type\u003euses\u003c/dependency-type\u003e\n        \u003c/dependent-module\u003e\n\nI was  able to call  the classes in the Util project successfully from the \nServlets in the Web project.",
    "Hmmm. Apparently I\u0027m missing some crucial step then. \n\nMy util classes are in a normal Java project. When I go to the web\nproject-\u003eproperties-\u003eJava Jar Dependency, the \"Set Web library project\ndependency\" option is grayed out and the select list is empty with no way to add\nanything.\n\nI am getting an error, however, if I go to the Java Jar Dependency properties\nsheet for my utility project. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s helpful, but here\u0027s the\nstacktrace from that:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.jface 4 2 2005-07-19 20:32:42.101\n!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in:\n\"org.eclipse.jface\".!STACK 0\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0\n        at\norg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.internal.common.ClasspathModel.initializeComponent(ClasspathModel.java:100)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.internal.common.ClasspathModel.setProject(ClasspathModel.java:94)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.internal.JARDependencyPropertiesPage.initialize(JARDependencyPropertiesPage.java:102)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.internal.JARDependencyPropertiesPage.createContents(JARDependencyPropertiesPage.java:174)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferencePage.createControl(PreferencePage.java:232)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jface.preference.PreferenceDialog.createPageControl(PreferenceDialog.java:1371)\n....\n\n",
    "For a standalone Web Project(not in the EAR), the option is grayed out, but \nthe table lists all the Utility modules and the Java projects available in the \nworkspace.\n\nIs your Java Project configured properly?, and what is the build you are using?",
    "I\u0027m using Web Tools 0.7 RC1 with all dependencies exactly as listed.\n\nThe error in my previous comment occurs with any Java Project I create, even in\na brand new workspace.\n\nNothing I do causes anything to show up in the select list for my web application.",
    "Derek can you verify this isn\u0027t still an issue with todays driver?",
    "This is working in current builds....note you may have to do a clean build on \nthe workspacce in some cases but that problem will be resolved in M8 when we \nmoved from the .deployables builder to publish tasks",
    "This change is a bulk update of all _un_targeted, fixed, resolved bugs upon release of M5. This particular bug _might_ have been fixed earlier than M5. (Feel free to correct). \n\n",
    "Closing."
