    "I\u0027ve been running successfully with 3.01 for months. I had a memory card upgrade\nand could not restart eclipse. I tried starting as eclipse -clean with no luck.\nThe following is the exception received:\n\n!SESSION Tue Feb 08 08:24:49 EST 2005 ------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Feb 08, 2005 08:24:49.531\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not find framework\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:395)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:174)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:704)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:688)\n\nI have found some anecdotal references to the above error but nothing that\nrelates to merely having added memory to the machine and nothing that provided\nme with a viable solution. I am adding this entry to bugzilla to accomplish\nthree goals; 1) find out what caused this, 2) find out how to fix this, and 3)\nserve as a anchor point for anyone else that has this problem as a follow-up.\nExisting \u0027solutions\u0027 such as \"oh, we found it, bad zip file\" or the like, or\n\"uninstall/reinstall are not really good solutions. \n\nI did resolve the problem by renaming the old directory path (equivalent to\ndeleting the old install) and reinstalling the product. I also saved off the\nproject workspaces and moved them back once I reinstalled. \n\nSo if you guys could follow-up with what configuration file needs to be deleted\nor otherwise modified that would be good. If you guys could fix eclipse startup\nsuch that a change in machine configuration wouldn\u0027t terminate a startup, that\nwould be better. \n\nThanks!",
    "That\u0027s a desired feature of eclipse :-)\nMore seriously, are you sure that nothing got moved / corrupted / deleted on\nyour HD?\nI only think of one thing:\n- the osgi plugin got deleted (or some of its content)\n\n",
    "The old eclipse plugin structure does have org.eclipse.osgi_3.0.1 as does the\nnew eclipse plugin. Really, the only thing that had changed was the addition of\n512meg of memory. Gone are the days of running in 640k ( as Chris Matthews would\nsay HAAAAA!). Seriously, what did occur to me as something different are the\nother plugins that worked (or atleast did not interfere) the day before. I am\none-for-one moving them to the new environment. As far as I can tell, the only\nplugins I was running were:\n\ncom.sysdeo.eclipse.tomcat_3.0.0 - moved back, no affect.\norg.eclipse.emf family\ncom.objectlearn family - I believe this is for lomboz as I recall.\n\nI am 100% confident nothing destructive occurred by way of missing or damaged\nfiles. I was happily stylin with Eclipse 3.x one moment, went to a gig of memory\nthe next moment, and could not start eclipse since. \n\nCan you tell from where the startup failed if it was loading eclipse or loading\nsomething else, like the plugins? BTW, this happened before the splash screen\nappeared if that helps.",
    "Iam having the same issue.  I am running on Windows 2000.  I downloaded Eclipse \nand I am trying to run it.  While it is opening.  I receive an error.

    "Basically this failure means it cannot find the OSGi framework. The failure\nhappens very early on - absolutely no plugins are loaded at this point. \nBasically, it looks for a sub-directory of the install location called\nplugins/org.eclipse.osgi_*, and if it doesn\u0027t find such a directory, it prints\nthis error message.  If you run with the \"-debug\" command line argument and\nprovide us with the resulting output, we might be able to find out what is going\non. Here is the command line to use (from the \"eclipse\" install directory):\n\njava.exe -jar startup.jar -debug\n",
    "We have never been able to reproduce this.  ",
    "This is most often caused by unzipping Eclipse without specifying that the ZIP directory sutrcture should be maintained. Apparently, some ZIP tools (WinZip) don\u0027t make this the default option and a lot of people end up unzipping the entire structure to a single directory.\nWhen Eclipse is unzipped, it should have an entire tree of subdirectories such as plugins, features, etc.",
    "I get a very similar error when trying to start Eclipse.\n\nRecently, I tried to install Eclipse-SDK-3.1.1-win32 to a Windows XP Pro system I had access to. The directory structure seemed to be intact.

    "I recieved the same error on MacOSX, after reading through this thread I noticed that I had overwritten my plugin and features directory when copying in a plugin.  \n\nI reinstalled eclipse and carfully copied over the plugin I wanted to install, making sure this time that I choose not to destructivly overwrite the directory contents and eclipse is now showing me love.\n\nHopefully this is also the case with windows users.\n\n\n"
