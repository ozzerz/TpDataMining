    "Background information: A TableTreeViewer is used to hold method call stack information and the call stack is retrieved by using DeferredTreeContentManager.\n\nThis exception occurred during retrieving large call stack, e.g. call stack that includes more than 10,000 invocation entries.\n\nThere are no other information available. The console outputs only:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java(Compiled Code))\n\nfor some times, say 8 times or 6 times by different tests.\n\nAfter these exceptions no more retrieving jobs can be done.\n\nTreeViewer with TreeColumn can not be used in eclipse3.0.2. Under eclipse3.2 I have tested that case. No exceptions occurred.\n\nThanks",
