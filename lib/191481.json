    "Using 2.2M6\n\nMy data source is stored in a library. When a drill-through hyperlink is placed in a group header, only the first link works.

    "Using 2.2.0.v20070529\n\nI had the same problem.\n\nI created two reports. The first report shows a table containing all persons. In one column I show the personNo which is a hyperlink to the second report. The second report shows a table containing the employee information of a person.\n\nIn the second report I used report parameters to determine which employee information should be shown in the table: the employee for which person.personNo\u003demployee.personNo holds.\n\nI created a library with a data source which connects to a Sybase database with the jconn3.jar driver. When I use this data source to connect two reports with a drill-through hyperlink I get the same error as Mark for all but the first hyperlink. Sometimes (not reproducible) I do not see the error in the HTML site but only in the log file. In this case the table in the second report is empty although there should be some entries.\n\nI did not use a group header but only a simple table.\n\nIn the preview both reports work fine. But when I open the first report in the BIRT viewer or as HTML and select the hyperlink I get the following exception:\n\norg.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.JDBCException: Missing properties in Connection.open(Properties).\n\tat org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.jdbc.Connection.open(Connection.java:108)\n\tat org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.oda.consumer.helper.OdaConnection.open(OdaConnection.java:235)\n...\n\nThe report parameters are correctly passed to the second report (I created labels which show the report parameters). And, as already mentioned, the first hyperlink in the table works fine, but all other hyperlinks in the table produce an exception.\n\nHope this information helps in solving the problem.\nJanneth\n",

    "can you please upload design files? It will be much better if these reports use sample data source/data set. So that we can go for further investigation.",
    "I really think that the problem is that we do not use the sample data base. Probably the exception only occurs if you use a different driver. I used a Sybase driver and Mark used an Oracle driver.\n\nI will attach my sample reports, but I modified it a bit to remove sensitive data.\nActually its really a very simple example and you should be able to create a similar example very quickly: two reports, the first has an hyperlink to the second, the second uses a report parameter, the data source uses a Sybase driver and is in a library.",

    "I tested the reports with birt-report-framework-sdk-2.2.1-N20070725 and the exception does not occur anymore!\n\nBut something interesting happened when I opened the first report (the one with the hyperlink) in the preview the first time: I got the JDBC exception already in the preview (before I only got the exeption in the report viewer or when I opened the report as HTML). \n\nI checked the driver settings of the data source and in the Manage JDBC Drivers view there was an \u0027x\u0027 in front of my driver. According to the legend this means \"The file does not exist in the ODA JDBC drivers directory\". But the location path was correct. After adding the driver again everything works fine. It seems as if the driver was not correctly added before ... (although the path location was correct).\n\nThis problem with the missing driver did only occur in the data source of the first report with the hyperlink. There was no problem in the other report. Although they both use the same data source (from the library).\n\nAnyhow, it seems to be fixed now :)"
