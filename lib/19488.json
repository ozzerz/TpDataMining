    "I installed eclipse version F2 (eclipse-SDK-20020502-win32.zip) on a PC running \nwin2000.  I then ran eclipse creating a simple \u0027HelloWorld\u0027 application.  I \nthen rebooted the machine to win98, and get the following error (eclipse will \nnot run):\n\n!SESSION ----------------------------------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 Jun 05, 2002 17:57:15.330\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not find bootstrap code. Check location of \nboot plug-in or specify -boot.\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.searchForBoot(Main.java:417)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:387)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:234)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:693)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:526)\n\n\nI then repeated the procedure by installing eclipse on win98 first.  When I \nthen reboot to win2000 everything is fine.  I am able to modify projects in \nboth win98 and win2000 with on difficulties in this scenario.",
    "Can you check the casing of the directories where you installed Eclipse? \nAlso note the file system type for the drive where you installed Eclipse.\nCould be a duplicate of Bug 19046.\nThanks.",
    "With reference to case sensitivity, I used lower case to specify the \ndirectories when I installed both eclipse and jdk1.3.1 on win2000 (d:\\f2_2000 \nand d:\\jdk1.3.1).  On win2000 both directories appear as expected, all lower \ncase.  When I use explorer on win98 the directory for eclipse appears as \nF2_2000, yet the jdk is jdk1.3.1.  The d drive is common between both win98 and \nwin2000.  I would not expect case sensitivity issues when running on a windows \nenvironment.\n\nDoes appear to be a duplicate of bug 19046\n\nNote: If jdk/eclipse installed on win98 first there is no issue in going \nbetween win2000 and win98.\n",
    "Marking as duplicate.\nAgreed that case should be ignored on a case-insensitive file system.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 19046 ***"
