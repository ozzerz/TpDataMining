    "Problem: using the BIRT 1.0 release bits and I have an ODA driver written as two\nplugins (following the flatfile ODA driver example) that I have written. I\nexported these plugins from my dev environment and installed them in eclipse,\nwith BIRT, GEF and EMF jSDK 1.4.2.08. The problem I\u0027m having is that when I\ncreate a template and bind my ODA datasource to the template and then preview\nthe report I get the following error in the preview tab: \n\n\"The design file C:\\dev\\birt\\App\\ReportInvestigation\\test_ODA_report.rptdesign\nhas error and can not be run. \" \n\nNote, that before the message is presented, there is a few moments of churning\nand the progress bar progresses like its doing some work then the preview pane\npresents that message. \n\nI have cleaned my workspace, did -clean everything and same results. \nI dug around in the log files and found the following meta.log that contains the\nfollowing exception, right after I run the report and get the error: \n\n2005-06-23 09:08:20  Message [Extension loading error] \n                     Exception\n[org.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.ExtensionException: Message:The\nextension point [org.eclipse.birt.report.model.encryptionHelper] is not found.\nError code:EXTENSION_POINT_NOT_FOUND \n    at\norg.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.ExtensionLoader.doLoad(ExtensionLoader.java:102)\n\n    at\norg.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.ExtensionLoader.load(ExtensionLoader.java:62)\n\n\nThe problem is actually that the ODA Custom plugin needs to be exported to 2\nplaces (I think). Once I added it to the viewer\u0027s plugins directory:\n\\eclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.birt.report.viewer_1.0.0\\birt\\WEB-INF\\plugins \n\nThe problem went away and I\u0027m no longer gettting the exception, or error message.",
    "Did engine generate this error msg or get from DTE?",
    "The plugins need deploy to server side also. Not a bug.",
    "*** Bug 102317 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Verified in build 20051222."
