I may be focus to/from a StyledText with selected text.  It may be selected text word wrap.  I wish I could help more.  I cannot seem to reproduce it, but our clients can\n\nMore information:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.doMouseWordSelect(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.doMouseLocationChange(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText.handleMouseMove(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.custom.StyledText$7.handleEvent(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.EventTable.sendEvent(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget.sendEvent(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.runDeferredEvents(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatch(Unknown Source)\n\tat XXX.main(XXX.java:676)\n\n{XXX Used to protect our privacy}",
    "I don\u0027t see how this is possible (NPE during doMouseWordSelect).\nwhen I get a stacktrace in .log it always has debug information in it (line number). How you get a stacktrace with line number information in it ?\n\nTry to work with your client to find the set of steps to reproduce this problem.\n\nThank you",
    "I\u0027m sorry, but I\u0027ve tried to reproduce it and I personally cannot.  I\u0027ve had 2 clients reproduce it in the past 2 days.  It something to do with highlighting text in a StyledText.  Is there any workaround or potential for me to catch and ignore the exception if one is thrown from that event?\n\nWould it be better to add a MouseMoveListener and do a...\n\ntry{\nsuper.mouseMove()\n}catch (Exception e){\n//Ignore\n}\n\nor is there a better workaround?  setCapture?",
    "OK, I\u0027ve been able to reproduce this bug.  Simply by double clicking repeatedly on a StyledText throws this NPE.  Sometimes is happens after a few clicks, sometimes it happens after 100 double clicks.  Myself and all my co-workers have been able to reproduce this simply by double-clicking on a word in a styled text.\n\nAnother scenario that might pin it down a little is simply by double clicking on a work to highlight it, then just move your mouse.  Pow.\n\n\n",
    "The setDoubleClickEnabled flag doesn\u0027t seem to change anything.  I would suspect that if this were false it would not allow one to select/highlight a word on a double-click.  There appears to be scenarios with double clicking and and mouse movement (at the same time) allows a word to be selected, followed by a NPE.",
    "Actually it only appears to happen when the setDoubleClickEnabled is false.",

    "Steps:\n1. setDoubleClickEnabled(false);\n2. double-click and hold the button down at the end of second click\n3. move the mouse\n\nI\u0027ll be fixing this in HEAD in a second.\nThanks for helping.\n",
