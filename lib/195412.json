    "Created an attachment (id\u003d73087)\nFix\n\nYou were right Markus, it is caused by the incompetent fix for bug 190434. My fault, I\u0027m terribly sorry. I hope this patch will be a better one.",
    "Wouldn\u0027t it be better to move the check to EclipseFile.getLogEntries(..) rather than polluting CVSFileHistory.refresh(..) with knowledge of the subtypes of ICVSFile?",

    "With the latest patch, I get no NPE and no History! I don\u0027t think you have the logic right in EclipseFile (i.e. I think you may want to negate the isAccessible check). ",

    "Patch released to 3.3.1.",
    "Verified in 3.4 M1 and M20070815-0800."
