    "All SWT applications seem to fail as follows when running from the SWT launch configuration.  From the stack trace, and from looking in the IDE\u0027s plugins folder, that the launch configuation is looking for the version of SWT that was shipped with Eclipse 3.2, rather than 3.2.1.\n\njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no swt-win32-3232 in java.library.path\n\tat java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:1517)\n\tat java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:788)\n\tat java.lang.System.loadLibrary(System.java:834)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Library.loadLibrary(Library.java:123)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.\u003cclinit\u003e(OS.java:18)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.\u003cclinit\u003e(Display.java:125)\n\tat swt.ForDavid.open(ForDavid.java:52)\n\tat swt.ForDavid.main(ForDavid.java:15)\nException in thread \"main\" \n\n\nEclipse 3.2.0 ships: org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.2.0.v3232m.jar\nEclipse 3.2.1 ships: org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.2.1.v3235.jar\n\nCan this please be fixed for Eclipse 3.2.2?",
    "Grant, do you remember anything about this?  It certainly isn\u0027t an SWT problem.",
    "I\u0027ve never heard of this, and I\u0027m quite sure this is not an swt problem.\n\nI assume you got your 3.2.1 install by using the update manager to upgrade a 3.2.0 install?\n",
    "Grant:\n  - I did NOT upgrade 3.2.0, but rather installed 3.2.1 from the Eclipse\n    download site.\n\n  - I did open a workspace that was originally created using 3.2.0.\n\n  - I created a new SWT lauch config using the Run As \u003e SWT Application menu.\n\n",
    "Grant, can you move this bug report to whoever you think owns this problem?",
    "I\u0027ve looked further into my set up and it seems that the project references JARs from SWT shipped with Eclipse 3.2, which is probably the reason for the error.\n\nBut it does demonstrate a problem building SWT apps against a different version of SWT to the one shipped with the IDE.  \n\nBecause my workspace originally was created using Eclipse 3.2 when I moved to Eclipse 3.2.1 I was effectively building an SWT v3232m application using Eclipse 3.2.1 that was expecting SWT v3235.\n\nClearly I have a fix now, but is this still something that needs addressing.\n",
    "Simon how does your app reference swt?\n  -\u003e is swt in your workspace, and your app points at it there? or...\n  -\u003e are you using the swt in your plugins directory? (I assume not if you have a clean 3.2.1 download), or...\n  -\u003e are you pointing at an swt jar somewhere else?\n\nI suspect that this behaviour will not happen as of eclipse/swt 3.3M4 since swt has started extracting its libs itself if needed.\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d57809)\nMy project\u0027s .classpath\n\nI am pointing directly at the SWT jars as shipped with Eclipse 3.2, but this was purely an accident since I was opening the workspace with Eclipse 3.2.1.",
    "I\u0027m not sure if Run As -\u003e SWT Application is expected to auto-extract the libraries from the swt jar when it\u0027s pointed at like this.\n\nMoving to PDE since this menu item comes from there.  This is no longer applicable in the 3.3 stream since this item was removed in 3.3M4.\n",
    "The SWT launcher has been completely removed in 3.3."
