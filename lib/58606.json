    "Compile the 2 attached files in Eclipse, and run p2.test2 from the command line\nwith the -Xfuture option. You will get this exception:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access method\np1.test1.doit()V from class p2.test2$1\n        at p2.test2$1.bar(test2.java:9)\n        at p2.test2.foo(test2.java:11)\n        at p2.test2.main(test2.java:17)\n\nEclipse does not seem to generate an accessor from p2.test2 to p1.test1, like\nSun\u0027s javac does.\n\nNote:\nI am using -Xfuture not because I want to be paranoid, but because I have this\nproblem when this code runs inside a Web application. The VM for the app. server\nis not started with -Xfuture, so I just assume that the VM is more strict  when\nthe code is loaded through a class loader.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d9517)\nTest classes\n",
    "Which version of Eclipse are you using ? Cannot reproduce in latest 3.0.",
    "Actually, I was able to reproduce it. I had forgot to specify \u0027-verify\u0027 on \ncommand line.",
    "Problem comes from the fact we did not perform emulation for static targets \n(fields or methods).\n\nFixed, added regression test InnerEmulationTest#test115",
    "Thanks for fixing this so quickly!",
