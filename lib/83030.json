    "works fine for me.\n\nThe problem here I suspect is that the name of the workspace area.\n\nTo set up for feature-based self-hosting, you must launch Eclipse and point to \na workspace directory whose last segment is \u0027plugins\u0027\n\nFor example: eclipse -data D:/UpdatedSource/plugins\n\nExample of what not to do: -data D:/UpdatedSource.",

    "I just did it again and it worked fine.\n\nThere is not much to it.\nhere are the steps again:\n\n1. Launch Eclipse as in : eclipse -data D:/newworkspace/plugins\n2. Use the \"External Plug-ins and Fragments\u0027 wizard to import all plugins into \nyour workspace.  Make sure you import WITHOUT links.  That is, in the \"Import \nAs\" section on the first page of the import wizard, make sure the FIRST option \nis selected.\n3. Import all features using the \"External Features\" import wizard.\n4. Create a new runtime workbench launch configuration.\n5. On the plugins tab of the launch config, choose the second option.\n6. Run.\n\n",
