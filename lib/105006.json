    "I hope this is user error.  I have never seen this type of symptom reported \nbefore.  Can you please double check that the RAC is running?  Can you confirm \nthat it is not running in secure mode?  Can you get a connection to port 10005 \nby telnet?  i.e. when you do\n\ntelnet localhost 10005\n\ndo you get a blank screen (indicating a connection), or do you get an error \nlike\n\nConnecting To localhost...Could not open connection to the host, on port \n10005: Connect failed\n\n",
    "yes, RAC is running in secure mode. \n\nThe latest rac is by default secure enabled.",
    "I don\u0027t know how a change like that gets checked in without some discussion.  \nI am pretty certain that the owners of the RAC know that test execution \ndoesn\u0027t work with secure RAC, so I\u0027m surprised to hear that it became the \ndefault without some sort of notice.....\n\nMarking as a dupe of the existing defect about test execution not support \nsecure RAC.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 95846 ***",
