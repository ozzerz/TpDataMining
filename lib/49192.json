    "I try to import an existing project into a workspace:\nThe workspace is in c:\\eclipse\\workspace and the project is in\nc:\\eclipse\\workspace\\rmi-generate\n\nThe wizard correctly identifies the directory (shows the project name),\nbut when I hit \"Finish\" it displays an error message \n\"Invalid project description\".\n\nI\u0027ve seen the other bug about it - but I see this behavior again and the project\nlocation is valid (directly under the workspace directory)\n\nI use Eclipse3.0M6 on WindowsXP.",
    "The other bug is bug #33684",
    "I see the other bug is assigned UI component, so I change it here as well.",
    "Changing owner to match component but will investigate to see what the story is.\nThe referenced bug was fixed in 2.1.1 so it shouldn\u0027t be a problem in the latest\nbuilds.",
    "Is there any information in your .log file? (/workspace/.metadata/.log)\n\nWhat directory is Eclipse installed in?",
    "Actually I\u0027ll move it back to Core until we can determine more information.",
    "I debugged it a little and here are the results - \nIt seems to happend for project which directory name is different from the\nproject name in the .project file.\n\nThe failing line is line 128 in the Project class\nworkspace.validateProjectLocation(project, location)\n\nGenady",
    "I am getting this too.\n\n\"Invalid project description\"\n\nc:/Development/Projects/CUWebAuth and c:/development/projects overlap.\n\nThis results in a bogus compile error:\n\n\"The project was not built since its build path is incomplete. Cannot find the\nclass file for java.lang.Object.\"\n\nMost of the time Eclipse is just fine but randomly it will start doing this and\nnothing will build.  I just specify my data directory with -data param as normal.\n\nAt no time have I ever nested projects or done anything like that.\n\nLog stacktrace is:\n\nJava Model Exception: Core Exception [code 77] Invalid project description.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.DeltaProcessingState$ProjectUpdateInfo.updateProjectReferencesIfNecessary(DeltaProcessingState.java:154)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.DeltaProcessingState.performClasspathResourceChange(DeltaProcessingState.java:223)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.SetClasspathOperation.updateProjectReferencesIfNecessary(SetClasspathOperation.java:771)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.SetClasspathOperation.executeOperation(SetClasspathOperation.java:246)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.JavaModelOperation.run(JavaModelOperation.java:700)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.run(Workspace.java:1673)\n....\n\nCaused by: org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Invalid\nproject description.\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project.checkDescription(Project.java:153)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project.setDescription(Project.java:887)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Project.setDescription(Project.java:931)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.DeltaProcessingState$ProjectUpdateInfo.updateProjectReferencesIfNecessary(DeltaProcessingState.java:151)",
    "Aaron, please file a new bug report as I believe your problem might be a\nseparate issue.\n\nGenady, I think I see what is going on. Don\u0027t know why I didn\u0027t see this before,\nsorry.\n\nEclipse manages all files underneath your workspace. If your workspace is at\nc:/eclipse/workspace then you cannot create a project at\nc:/eclipse/workspace/rmi-generate unless its created at the \"default location\".\n\nTherefore, instead of doing an import, you need to create a new project and just\naccept the default location. It will see that there is a project description\nfile already there and use that one and restore all your previous project data.\n\nLet me know if this doesn\u0027t solve your problem.",
    "My problem is that sometimes I wish to reset the workspace by erasing the \nmetadata. \n\nIs creating a new project equivalent to importing it?\n\nWhat happens if the project name is different from the directory name (I think \nit doesn\u0027t work well, but I didn\u0027t check recently).\n\nGenady",
    "If the project is in the default content area, then you have to create a new\nproject. (you aren\u0027t allowed to import it and you can\u0027t create a new one with a\nnew name and the old location)\n\nIf the project name is different than the directory name, that\u0027s ok if the\nproject content area is not in the default area. For example:\n- workspace is in c:/eclipse/workspace\n- create new project MyProject\n- set project contents to be c:/temp/MyContents\n\nAre there problems that are causing you to reset your workspace? In theory you\nshould be able to keep the same workspace across multiple builds. I upgrade to a\nnew Eclipse integration build every week and I\u0027ve had the same workspace for\nabout 3 years now.",
    "Based on comment #6 and the original comment, this bug appears to be a duplicate of bug 143757.",
    "(In reply to comment #11)\n\u003e Based on comment #6 and the original comment, this bug appears to be a\n\u003e duplicate of bug 143757.\n\nLooks like it is the same bug. Nice to have it fixed."
