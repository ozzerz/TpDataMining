    "1. Create a project with a linked folder to RSE (FTP).\n2. Open one of the files from the linked folder , edit it +  save it.\n   (NOT from the RSE view/browser)\n3. Now go to Remote Systems view (browser) and double click the same file you\n   just saved. You see that the change is in sync. *this is what you think...\n4. Go back to the saved linked file from the project and open it.\n   You get a message that \"This file has been changed on the file system...\"\n\nI noticed this bug when it made trounles when I tried to do the following after I saved the file:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n IFileStore fileStore \u003d EFS.getStore(uri); //uri is rse://MY_FILE... blablabla\n IFileInfo fileInfo \u003d fileStore.fetchInfo();//I get a DIRTY file info !!! (old)\n byte[] bytes \u003d new byte[(int) length];\n\n InputStream openInputStream \u003d fileStore.openInputStream(EFS.NONE, null);\n DataInputStream in \u003d new DataInputStream(openInputStream);\n in.readFully(bytes);//this throws an exception :\n\njava.io.EOFException\n\tat java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.io.DataInputStream.readFully(Unknown Source)\n\nThis exception does not happen if I refresh the file properly (steps 3-4).",
    "Hm, the caching logic in RSEFileStore seems ok. But it might be that IRemoteFileSubSystem.getRemoteFileObject() gives us a cached file object which is out of date.\n\nIt might be that when saving a file through EFS (i.e. when creating an output stream, perhaps also when closing the output stream) we need to do\n  getRemoteFileObject().markStale()\nto ensure that the next fetchInfo() will get fresh information from the remote.\n",
    "I just mentioned RSEFileStore because this is where I get the file info object...",
    "Hi all.\n\nAny news regarding this one ?\nIs it fixed for 3.0 M3 ?"
