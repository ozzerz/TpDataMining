    "When adding a public key secured cvs repository I got the very helpful error \nmessage: Error validating location: \"\" \nI added the repository though, but of course wasn\u0027t able to connect. When \nattempting to open the HEAD I got an error: \"Fetching children of HEAD\" with an \nNPE. \nAfter several hours of searching for an solution without being able to make any \nprogress in my work I finally found out that I have to reduce the size of my \nRSA key from 4096 to 1024 bits (don\u0027t know if 2048 etc works). Now I\u0027m able to \nconnect without any problems...",
    "Yamanaka, is there a key length restriction in the jsch client?\n\nIsn\u0027t blocking since there is a workaround. Changing severity.",
    "Thanks Alex, you just saved me from getting mad. This nasty little bug has kept \nme busy for the last 3 hours :) \nWith a smaller key it works like a charm! \n \nI fully agree on the usefullness of the error messages... \n \nBTW: Is it possible to use a native ssh client? Why reinvent the wheel (at \nleast on unix/linux platform) particularly for security relevant things? ",

    "  |Yamanaka, does this mean that keys \u003e 1024 bits are now supported?\n\nNo.  \nIt depends on the implementation of JCE(Java Cryptgraphy Extension) \nincluded in the Java runtime.  On my environment, I had that problems \nfor 5120 bits key, but I did not get such a problem for 2048 bits.  \nAnyway, I think that almost of all users, who understand what they are \ndoing, will not choose such a large key.\nSo, IMHO, it is not required to support them.\nThe current implmentation will just fail for that key, \nbut will not be crashed.\n",
    "Based on Yamanaka\u0027s last comment, it appears that we support reasonably sized \nkeys and fail gracefully when a key that is too large is used. It also sounds \nlike there is no pla to support larger keys in JSch on which the SSH2 plugin \nin Eclipse depends so I\u0027m marking this as wontfix."
