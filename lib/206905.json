    "Build ID: M20070921-1145\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1.Open a BPEL diagram generated with another BPEL editor.  \n2.Modify the diagram (even a simple layout change will do)\n3.Save the diagram\n4.Close the diagram\n5.Reopen the diagram\nThe diagram will now be empty and the related .bpel file will be of zero length\n\n\nMore information:\nThe file is destroyed upon save though the diagram will display OK until you close it",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d83665)\nBPEL process with extensions\n\nThis BPEL file can be viewed with BPEL designer, but a produces a zero-length file when saved.",
    "Okay, I try this again :-) The attached BPEL file was created with BPEL Designer. Then an extension to use the file with the ActiveBPEL Engine were added by hand. The process deploys fine on the ActiveBPEL Engine. The resulting file can be viewed with the Designer, but saving produces a zero-length file. The stack trace is as follows:\n\n java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.apache.xerces.util.DOMUtil.copyInto(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.bpel.model.extensions.BPELUnknownExtensionSerializer.marshall(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.bpel.model.resource.BPELWriter.extensibleElement2XML(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.bpel.model.resource.BPELWriter.process2XML(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.bpel.model.resource.BPELWriter.resource2XML(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.bpel.model.resource.BPELWriter.write(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.bpel.model.resource.BPELResourceImpl.doSave(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.impl.ResourceImpl.save(ResourceImpl.java:1253)\n\nThe more general problem seems to be how errors are handled when saving BPEL files. It seems that when an error occurs, a file of zero-length is created, but saving seems to appear to have succeeded, e.g. the dirty indicator (* in the title tab) is cleared and no error message is shown.",
    "Hi,\n\na zero bpel file is also generated by adding a comment to an assign:\n\n-create new project\n-add assign\n-use \"fixed value\" as from\n-add \u003c!-- something --\u003e as startline, followed by valid xml (declaration)\n-use \"variable\" as to\n-save\n-close\n-reopen\n\nBuild ID M20071023-1652"
