    "the debug jvm completely crashes on the moment i do a save: I get error dialog \nof Windows XP\n\nAppName: javaw.exe AppVer: 0.0.0.0 ModName: jvm.dll\n\nModVer: 0.0.0.0 Offset: 0004eef5\n\nand if i look into the Error Report Contents (which i can\u0027t seem to copy pase \nas text)\nthen i get a lot of\nd:/jdk1.4/hotspot\\src\\share\\vm\\runtime\\arguments.cpp\nd:/jdk1.4/hotspot\\src\\share\\vm\\memory\\concurentMarkSweepGeneration.\n(complete dumpst of memory blocks)\n\nIt is a bit better then before, then i couldn\u0027t also debug because the \nconnection\nseems to get lost and everything hung then. But now i have to look that i \ndon\u0027t do a save\nof a file that is being used in the debugger.\n\nMaybe there should be an option to disable hotswap?\n\nAre the debug option that i can use to get a better stacktrace out of \neclipse/debugger?\n\n\nWhat i did after that i started my application as a remote debug application \nwith:\njava -Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler\u003dNONE -\nXrunjdwp:transport\u003ddt_socket,server\u003dy,address\u003d8000\n\ni did connect and could step.\n\nBut when i made a change when i was steppin and compiled/saved it:\n\neclipse popuped an error:\nAn Internal Error occured:\nVMDisconnectedException: got IOException from VM see error log for more \ndetails:\n4 org.eclipse.ui 0 Failed to execute runnable \n(com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException: Got IOException from Virtual Machine)\norg.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Failed to execute runnable \n(com.sun.jdi.VMDisconnectedException: Got IOException from Virtual Machine)\n at org.eclipse.swt.SWT.error(SWT.java:1887)\n at org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Synchronizer.runAsyncMessages(Synchronizer.java:96)\n\nand the debug JVM:\n\n#\n# HotSpot Virtual Machine Error, Internal Error\n# Please report this error at\n# http://java.sun.com/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi\n#\n# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (1.4.0-rc-b91 mixed mode)\n#\n# Error happened during: get/set locals\n#\n# Error ID: 47454E45524154452F4F502D41500E4350500848\n#\n# Problematic Thread: prio\u003d5 tid\u003d0x00953250 nid\u003d0x574 runnable\n#\n\nI will send this also to Sun but i hope you guys are working really closely \nwith Sun to get this hotswap support\nreally right when 1.4 FCS hits the streets.",
    "Johan, can you provide us with a simple example of code that causes the problem \nevery time? Where do you set the breakpoint, and which code do you change? This \nis critical to solving the problem.",
    "No test case provided. Closing."
