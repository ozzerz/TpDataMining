    "I am entering this bug to track the problem related to the JDT Debug JUnit \ntests failing intermittently due to NoClassDefFoundError.  \n\nhttp://fullmoon/downloads/drops/N20050912-\n0010/testresults/html/org.eclipse.jdt.debug.tests_macosx.carbon.ppc.html\n\nWe set vm args as per bug 106230.",
    "Kevin added \u0027ProjectCreationDecorator.testBuildComplete()\u0027. The test failed as \nfollows, which indicates our test project is not built before our test suite \nruns (thus, all the No class def found errors).\n\noutput folder is empty \n\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError: output folder is empty\nat org.eclipse.jdt.debug.tests.ProjectCreationDecorator.testBuildComplete\n(ProjectCreationDecorator.java:247)\nat org.eclipse.jdt.debug.tests.DebugSuite$1.run(DebugSuite.java:53)\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:552)\n",
    "Have not seen these failures for some time. It seems that they were caused by a\nbuild failure of some kind. Since creating a test that forces a full build of\nthe imported workspace, and waits for that build to complete, the test suite has\nbeen running much better.\n",
    "Darin, please verify",
    "Verified the test have not failed in similar manner since full build was added."
