    "I tried it with GEdit and Totem and both don\u0027t crash.\n\nI had Eclipse 3.0.2 lying around and installed that.

    "Eclipse 3.0.2 uses GtkFileSelection while 3.1 uses GtkFileChooser where\navailable (it only exists in GTK+ 2.4 or newer).\n\nYou\u0027re sure the crash only happens when running under GNOME?  Could it be the\nLOCALE settings?",
