I am FreeBSD user, and I have SWT library (3.1) installed on two computers. One is working ok, but other is not. Only difference betwen computers is that one is connected to internal network (that one is working), and the other one is connected to internet directly (through other internet line). I have tried to \"fix\" all 4 points and I have somewhat succeeded.\n\n1. The DISPLAY environment variable is unset\n    I have set it to localhost:0\n2. The host/port information is wrong\n    I have added my hostname to /etc/hosts and X doesn\u0027t complain anymore\n3. The X server is down\n    IS NOT.\n4. The socket to the X server is on too high of a file descriptor\n    Mhm. i can\u0027t do anything with this. I tried to set that JAVA_HIGH...    \n    variable, but it doesn\u0027t work on FreeBSD\n\nI am using FreeBSD 6.1 (RC1 on first computer and RELEASE on second), Java version 1.5.0_06 (I tried with both versions, with home build and that that is available as download now). Application producing this error is Azureus. Computer is AMD 2.2 Gb (Single core 32-bit), 512 Mb of memory.\n\nI have also tried with this sample in this forum, and I get the same problem.\n\nAndy",

    "(In reply to comment #26)\n\nAndy, thanks for your comments.  This defect (SMP Linux IA32) has been verified as working as designed using TPTP V4.2.0.  Please open a SWT defect for your issue with the sample code from this defect (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id\u003d38323).",
    "Using the TPTP-4.2.0-200605290100 workbench and Agent Controller (SWT V3.2 RC6) on the SMP test machine (Linux purple 2.6.9-5.ELsmp #1 SMP Wed Jan 5 19:30:39 EST 2005 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux) and IBM JRE V1.5.0 (SR 2), the Manual Test View is working as designed after verifying the following:\n\n 1. The DISPLAY environment variable is set.\n 2. The host/port information is correct (e.g. added to /etc/hosts). \n 3. The X server is up.\n\nOpened defect https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d144777 to address the information dialog (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d115648#c24).",
    "ACTION: Please verify/close this defect.",
    "Closing.",
    "I ran into this problem as well.  I could not solve until I noticed a peculiarity in the environment tab of the run configuration dialog: normally, the radio buttons \"Append environment to native environment\" and \"Replace native environment with the specified environment\" are available, but in this case they are both disabled and grayed out.  I suppose this means the environment is replaced rather than appended, which is most certainly not what I want.  In any case, I worked around this by manually configuring the DISPLAY and HOME environment variables.  I looked at /proc/$pid/environ to confirm these variables did not exist in the environment.\n\nI suggest that these radio buttons should not be disabled, and append should be the default, as it is when not running under the profiler.\n",
    "(In reply to comment #33)\n\nThanks Shane for this information.  When the user launches a TPTP Manual Test using the Test Launch Configuration (opposed to a SWT Applciat5ion Launch Configuration), the Environment tab is not exposed since the Manual Test View is launched by the Integrated/Agent Controller using its configuration.  Ultimately, the DISPLAY and HOME environment variables must be configured on the machine (as well as Mozilla) for the Manual Test View to successfully launch.",
