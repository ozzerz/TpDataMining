    "When attempting to retrieve a list of branches, the following error is  \ngenerated:  \n   \n\"repository error     \norg.eclipse.stellation.repos.database.WrappedSQLException: Error retrieving    \nbranch version comment java.sql.SQLException: ERROR:  Relation \"tbv\" does not    \nexist    \n   \tat    \norg.eclipse.stellation.repos.LocalHandle.getBranchVersionComment(LocalHandle.java:1337)   \n\" \n \nI have traced through the LocalHandle code, and _db.executeQueryStatement is \nthrowing a WrappedSQLException with the message cited. \n \nThe version under test is Bugzilla-32290. \n \nThe bug likely occurs with getBranchComment as well. \nNote: it\u0027s possible that a branch revision comment was not entered (I will \ncheck), but in this case I would expect an empty string to be returned (as was \npreviously the case) rather than needing to catch an exception.",
    "\nThis is already fixed as a part of my work-in-process on 31915.\n\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 31915 ***"
