    "I am your average java developer and I have been given the task to evaluate Birt with our Weblogic application. I downloaded the report viewer and thought I went through all the steps to get it to run in an application server but I kept getting the following errors. I will appreciate a very basic zip file of a working model that I could test out.\nSome of the errors I get are:\n1)  That there was error in the initialization of the viewer\n2)  The report was not able to find the right extention for an encrytion class\n3)   The weblogic.xml and web.xml are not properly form",
    "Can we try weblogc 8.1 sp6 or latest.",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Can we try weblogc 8.1 sp6 or latest.\n\u003e \nAfter modifying the web.xml with the location of the birt root, I was able to deploy, build and run the sample viewer but, the parameter page will not come up.

what I need to do.\n\nAlso, I could never get the sample web viewer to build in workshop. I was only able to deploy the example viewer using the weblogic console.\n\nBy the way, thanks for your response.\n",

    "My company will be making decision in about a week whether to go with birt or Jasper. I still could not get birt to work with weblogic even after downloading the latest birt release2.0. My weblogic environment is 8.1.5 SP5. Please see that this issue get resolved as I really want us to use birt because of its ease of use.",
    "Ola,\n\nWe deploy the veiwer successfully on Weblogic 8.1 sp4 without modifing any web.xml settings.\n\nThe error you posted probably casued by the precompiling of jsp pages. I am not sure how you get those web.xml files. It should be got from birt.war file instead of building it yourself. Since when you do the build, some jsp precompile is triggered and you can see additional servlet mappings shown up in the web.xml. Compare web.xml after build to web_deploy.xml you can see the difference.\n\nI am suggesting you get the birt.war file. Extract it into folders, adding necessary jars and js libs. then do a folder deploy on weblogic 8sp4 or sp6. Per one of our team member, they do have some difficulties in deploy thing on sp5 in other project (not sure this is still true for BIRT).\n\n ",

    "I have been able to deploy the sample application successfully without any stress on SP5. The steps that need to be followed are:\n\n1) create a new domain in weblogic.\n2) copy the axis jar files (all of them - 9 in number), prototype.js and itext jar file to the location specified on Birt site \n3) Open the weblogic admin console and deploy the sample application using the web viewer folder\n4) Click the test application tab and click on the link for your web deployment.  Your application should come up.\n\nNeed nothing fancy at all.\n\nThanks everyone for your input to this issue.",
    "Yeah it is working fine on BEA WebLogic Server 8.1 SP5 but \nnot on WebLogic Integration Server SP5. The problem is with the integration version.\n\n",
