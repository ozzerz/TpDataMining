    "When creating a new SRM connection, the user will get an exception\n     eu.geclipse.core.GridException: Unspecified IO problem\n\tat eu.geclipse.efs.srm.SRMStore.fetchChildren(Unknown Source)\n\tat eu.geclipse.efs.srm.SRMStore.childNames(Unknown Source)\nif he/she choose the wrong port (SRM v1 instead of v2.1 etc). \nSee related issue #208546.\n\nIt would make sense to \"ping\" the service before establishing a new connection to make sure we are contacting a valid SRM service, and inform the user if the service is not what it is expected to be.\nAt least srm v2.2 provides the srmPing() function, hopefully v2.1.1 has the same (didn\u0027t check)"
