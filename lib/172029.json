    "Build ID: M20060921-0945  \n\nSteps To Reproduce:\npublic void launchConfigurationRemoved(ILaunchConfiguration configuration) {\t\t\t\t\n\n configuration.getType(); \u003c-- throws an exception.\t\t\t\t\t\n\t}\n\nthe exception is:\n\norg.eclipse.debug.core.DebugException: Launch configuration hiberggnate (3) at C:\\work\\documents\\presentations\\jbw-berlin\\workspace\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.debug.core\\.launches\\hiberggnate (3).launch does not exist.\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchManager.createDebugException(LaunchManager.java:778)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchManager.getInfo(LaunchManager.java:1175)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.getInfo(LaunchConfiguration.java:356)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.getType(LaunchConfiguration.java:487)\n\nEither the implementation or the java doc is wrong since it states handle-only methods are ok to call in the remove listener.\n\nMore information:",
    "That is true, handle only methods are safe to call, BUT the doc also states:\n\n * A launch configuration is a handle to its underlying storage.\n * Methods annotated as \"handle-only\" do not require a configuration\n * to exist. Methods that require an underlying configuration to exist\n * throw a \u003ccode\u003eCoreException\u003c/code\u003e when an underlying configuration\n * is missing.\n\nwhere getType(..) is a handle only method that does require the configuration to exist (as is doc\u0027d). Only handle-only attributes of a launch configuration are available once it has been removed, not access to its underlying storage.\n\nA simple fix for this on your end would be to use the method ILaunchConfiguration.exists(), before calling handle-only methods.\n\nmarking as WONTFIX",
    "My problem is that how else can one see if the LaunchConfiguration that is being removed is relevant or not for the code ?\n\nThe type is a unique id, but the only other info I apparently can get is the name, but that is definitly not unique nor a way to identify the launchconfiguration.",
    "The namespace for launch configurations is flat so the name is sufficient to uniquely identify the configuration.\n\nYou can also do a launchconfig.equals(anotherconfig).",
    "The name is sufficient to identify it, but not to know the details of what\u0027s in it. \n\nPerhaps you could have a pre-deletion listener in the model instead of merely post-deletion? That way the user could see the entire configuration, its attributes, etc, before it gets clobbered adn deleted?\n\nOr are you suggesting users keep a duplicate model of the launch configurations and their attributes, in sync, just in case the config is eventually deleted? ",
    "my usecase would just benefit from knowing what type it is so i could avoid doing a possible expensive lookup to see if I need to clean something up after the removal."
