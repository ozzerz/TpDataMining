    "I20070911-0833\n\nI can\u0027t build my workspace anymore in the latest IBuild: The progress hangs at 61% and progress message cycles from cleaning, analyzing, compiling and back.\nIt seams to reset always in the same package (eclipse/jdt/ui/wizards)\n\nI can reproduce with a 1.5 and a 1.6 vm.\n\nNothing in the log.\n\nThis happened after switching to the newest IBuild on start. I did turn off auto build, clean all, and I was able to build the workspace. If I close jdt/ui project with autobuild enabled it does hang again, I have to clean all again. This is a blocker for me I have to go back to the last IBuild. Mmm, interesting: When starting last weeks IBuild it says: \n!MESSAGE The workspace exited with unsaved changes in the previous session; refreshing workspace to recover changes.\nAlthough that\u0027s not true.",
    "This must be caused by the change for bug 89301.\n\nSomehow the project\u0027s builder must think its been interrupted.\n\nI\u0027ll remove the change for now.\n\n\n\nBenno - how many projects were in your workspace ?\n\nWas it in sync with CVS before you switched to the new I build ?",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Benno - how many projects were in your workspace ?\n67\n\n\u003e Was it in sync with CVS before you switched to the new I build ? \nNo",
    "All we\u0027re doing is checking to see if the project\u0027s builder believes it has been interrupted because of a change to one of its resources.\n\nJohn - what kind of resource changes could cause a project to constantly think its been interrupted?",
    "Do you have a reproducible case? There is a .options file flag for tracking this down:\n\n# Reports the cause of autobuild interruption\norg.eclipse.core.resources/build/interrupt\u003dtrue\norg.eclipse.core.resources/debug\u003dtrue\n\n",
    "Benno - please try your workspace with the latest I-build again with the options enabled.\n\nI\u0027ve tried my JDT/UI workspace \u0026 its fine.\n\nWe also haven\u0027t heard from any other developers that this is a problem for them.",

    "The workspace runnable for which prepareOperation is called resulting in the reset is: org.polarion.team.svn.core.utility.ProgressMonitorUtility$2@ec2bb1\nthey do pass in a none null scheduling rule: org.polarion.team.svn.core.operation.AbstractNonLockingOperation$NonLockingRule@16163b9",
    "yep, removing the subversive plugin did help. I can build the workspace without it.",
    "I suspect this operation has always been interrupting your autobuilds, but it\u0027s now more noticeable because the interruption has a much larger cost. Previously, the build would have been restarted, but each time it would successfully run one builder. Eventually all builders would run successfully, even with constant interruption. Now, it\u0027s not making any progress at all because the interruption causes the builder to restart from scratch.\n\nThis is clearly a bug in the Polarion plugin you have installed, and it should be reported to them. However, if a misbehaving plugin can have such a drastic effect, I\u0027m not sure we can fix bug 89301 after all.",
    "I agree.\n\nIf a misbehaving plugin can cause a builder to believe its interrupted then we cannot use it.",
    "Removed the complete patch for bug 89301",
