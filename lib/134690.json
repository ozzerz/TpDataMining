    "Just want to up the severity of this - I can not launch a debug session (regular works though), which makes things a bit unnecessarily tricky :-)\n\nHaving said that, I can confirm that it is a Locale issue - I use Swedish settings. Setting to English/United States it seems to work. I haven\u0027t yet been able to narrow it down to exactly which setting causes the problem though.\n\nSo, this is a workaround, but not very palatable...I hope this can be addressed fairly quickly.",

If I understand comment #7 correctly ICU 3.4.4 is already done. Considering it is a single plugin and that the version numbers indicate bugfixes that I assume does not violate interfaces etc, would it be possible to make a com.ibm.ico_3.4.4.jar available for patching my M6?\n\nActually, I have already tried to take 3.4.4 directly from the ICU site, but as that is not a bona fide plugin, I\u0027m unsure if you massage it a bit more to make things work...",
