    "Build I200506091102\n\nReloading a genmodel from an ecore file is very broken.  Here are the details:\n\nSelect a genmodel, right click and select Reload...\nSelect EMF ecore model\nClick Next\nNothing happens\nClick Next\nError dialog appears saying that you need to select an ecore model\nDismiss the error dialog\nThe Model URI field will be empty - it used to contain the paths to the ecore files that were previously \nloaded\nThe Generator model file name field will be empty - it should default to the selected genmodel\n\nIf you fill in the Model URI, and the genmodel name, you can get to the next page\nSelect the packages, add the referenced generator models and select the appropriate referenced \npackages\nClick Finish\nYou get a NPE\n\n\nIf you are able to reproduce this, any chance you could spin another integration build with the fix?",
    "Bryan, \n\nNo I can\u0027t reproduce this (in my develop environment nor in a fresh install of\nRC1 and the latest EMF driver). It sounds to me like you have a bad installation. \nHave you tried running with -clean.  Note that we moved to using manifests in\nthis build, and some folks are seeing strange access errors and failures to load\nclasses when they update an existing installation.\n\nIf your problem persists with clean installation, please show the stack traces\nin the .log and reopen the bugzilla.  We likely also need the sample files you\nare reloading as well, i.e., the .genmodel and .ecore...",
    "Bryan,\n\nI encountered this problem:\n\n!STACK 0\norg.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList$BasicIndexOutOfBoundsException: index\u003d1,\nsize\u003d1\n  at java.lang.Throwable.\u003cinit\u003e(Throwable.java)\n  at\norg.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList$BasicIndexOutOfBoundsException.\u003cinit\u003e(BasicEList.java:494)\n  at org.eclipse.emf.common.util.BasicEList.get(BasicEList.java)\n  at\norg.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.genmodel.impl.GenOperationImpl.initialize(GenOperationImpl.java:585)\n\nwhich reveals a long standing but in GenOperationImpl.initialize.\n\nIt\u0027s very easy to fix.  I\u0027ll reopen this bugzilla to fix it, I\u0027ll attach the\n.class file so that you can patch your driver, and I\u0027ll downgrade the severity\nsince you\u0027ll have a workaround.\n\nYou also seem to have a broken Ecore reference from\nprog/Program/execute/executionHarness to its type.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d22820)\nCompiled fix for problem\n\nThis class can be used to patch org.eclipse.emf.codegen.ecore.",
    "The fix is commited to CVS.",
    "Fixed in build 2.1.0 I200506160200 (Eclipse 3.1 RC2).",
    "I just installed the new integration build, and I\u0027ve run into this problem\nagain.  It\u0027s with a different project/genmodel, but same error log.",
    "My bad, I just realized that the latest download on the download page is not the\nlatest integration build.  It\u0027s one build behind."
