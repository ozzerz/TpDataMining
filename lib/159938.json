    "RAC: 4.2.1 GA Build\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Install RAC on OS/400 machine\n2. Enable security\n3. Start the RAC\n4. Profile a simple application from the client workbench\n\nProblem:\nThe console view does not show any output, however ,the profiling terminates itself and collects data.  ",
    "Yet another platform showing the console failure (see also bug 159678). Looks like this is a regression that needs a quick triage on what might have introduced it. Raising to critical.\n\nThe version shows 4.2.1 - is this an intermittent problem such that it didn\u0027t show up in prior testing of 4.2.1?",
    "\nNavid fixed an issue with console early on in the 4.2.1 time frame... back at the start of i1. It is possible that his fix did make it into this platform.",

    "Seems to be sensitive to the delay in determining whether the client is reachable by the Agent Controller inside the Console.java code using the file transfer service.\n\nChaning to all platform since this is not iSeries specific. iSeries does not redirect the console back to the Agent Contorller machine because it does not have a console (it is a batch job).\n",

    "This problem is becoming extremely intermitten now. I have been testing with the TPTP 4.3 i3 test pass driver and so far the console comes up fine when I remote profile from Windows to iSeries.\n\nThe problematic scenario is that if the determineServerReach() method fails for any reason other than a client-side firewall, the client is told that the console is not available (since the file server determineServerReach() says so) and thus not starting the console thread. More investigation is required to see what can cause the determineServerReach() check to fail.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d53490)\nFirst possible exception\n\nIn the last few minutes the console starts to fail again. I\u0027ve captured two possible exceptions generated from the determineServerReach() method.",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d53774)\nPatch #1\n\nPatch for the execution framework.",
    "Retrying the sending of the determine server reach command seems to solve the problem. The patch I implemented will try to send the command 3 times and only fail after that.\n",
