    "Eclipse 3.3 does not always do the right thing when creating Topics from other Topics or ITopics. This bug describes three separate problems:\n\n1. If a child is removed from a Topic after it has been used in the constructor for another Topic an exception is thrown:\n\norg.w3c.dom.DOMException: NOT_FOUND_ERR: An attempt is made to reference a node in a context where it does not exist.\n\tat org.apache.xerces.dom.ParentNode.internalRemoveChild(Unknown Source)\n\nWhile the exception could easily be caught and ignored a better fix would be to keep the child nodes in synch with the parent nodes.\n\nSee JUnit test testCopyTopicWithChildRemoveChild() which I will attach.\n\n2. If a Topic with a child is used in the constructor for another Topic both the old and new Topic will think they own the same child(). This means that calling getParent() for a child topic will not always return the original topic. I think that this is potentially dangerous.\n\nSee JUnit test testCopyTopicWithChildCheckParents()\n\n3. If a Topic \u0027t\u0027 is constructed from an ITopic and that ITopic has a child the child topic of \u0027t\u0027 will always be enabled, regardless of the enablement status of he original child. I believe that this would mean that code which used the API to create a TOC would not have child topics filtered as expected.\n\nSee JUnit test testUserTopicWithFilteredChildren",
