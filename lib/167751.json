    "Driver:  WTP 2.0 12121445\n\nWhen going through Web service client scenario, the wizard issue the error:\n\nIWAB0014E Unexpected exception occured.\n  Class javax/xml/namespace/QName violates loader constraints\n      java.lang.LinkageError: Class javax/xml/namespace/QName violates loader constraints\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis.consumption.ui.task.Stub2BeanCommand.execute(Stub2BeanCommand.java:115)\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis.consumption.ui.task.ClientCodeGenOperation$ClientWSModifyOperation.execute(ClientCodeGenOperation.java:110)\n      at org.eclipse.jst.ws.internal.axis.consumption.ui.task.ClientCodeGenOperation.execute(ClientCodeGenOperation.java:61)\n      at org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.core.fragment.CommandFragmentEngine.runCommand(CommandFragmentEngine.java:414)\n\nThis scenario works in the 1207 I-build.",
    "Instead of using eclipse-SDK-I20061211-1607-win32.zip, if I switch back to use eclipse-SDK-3.3M3-win32.zip, then the problem does not occur.  So it seems like something in eclipse-SDK-I20061211-1607-win32 cause this class loading issue.",
    "Similar \"violates loader constraints\" errors occurs for top-down, bottom-up and WSE. This is similar to the issues mentioned in bug 167695.\n\nI tried moving wsdl4j and xerces in front of org.eclipse.core.runtime in the require bundle for the manifest.mf.\n\nI was able to then go through the scenarios successfully with the Eclipse 1211 driver.  However, I ran into problem with the 1213 Eclipse driver (bug 167992) and was not able to see if this will fix the problem or not with that latest driver.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d55633)\nPatch for moving wsil4j and xerces in front of core.runtime\n\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d55634)\nPatch for moving org.eclipse.core.runtime to last in required bundle\n\n",
    "I tested again with the WTP wtp-sdk-I-I200612150220-200612150220 driver with these prereqs:\n\nunzip -o d:\\download\\wtp\\wtp20\\eclipse-SDK-I20061213-1300-win32.zip\nunzip -o d:\\download\\wtp\\wtp20\\emf-sdo-xsd-SDK-2.3.0M3.zip\nunzip -o d:\\download\\wtp\\wtp20\\GEF-SDK-3.2.1.zip\nunzip -o d:\\download\\wtp\\wtp20\\JEM-SDK-1.2.1.zip\nunzip -o d:\\download\\wtp\\wtp20\\dtp-sdk_1.0RC1.zip\n\nI used emf-sdo-xsd-SDK-2.3.0M3.zip instead of emf-sdo-xsd-SDK-I200612071030.zip as specified in the WTP 2.0 12150220 driver page to work around bug 167992.\n\nWith the above set of prereq and WTP 2.0 drivers, I was able to go through bottom-up, top-down, client and Web Services Explorer no problem.  I have not run into the \"violate loader constraint\" problem even without applying the patch in this defect.  So it looks like eclipse-SDK-I20061213-1300-win32.zip\nhas different behaviour than eclipse-SDK-I20061211-1607-win32.zip.  \n\nAs a result of this finding, I\u0027m lowering the severity of this defect for now and will test again once the official Eclipse M4 is available.\n\n\n",
    "Not a problem anymore with recent WTP 2.0.x or WTP 3.0 drivers.",
    "Verified and closing."
