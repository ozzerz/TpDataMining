    "We have just released a major eFix for WSAD that upgrades the workbench to \n2.0.3. The v1.0.1 Core Tools patch causes a 2.0.3 workbench to not start. Could \nwe please get an update because we would like to continue to run the \nperformance tools.  \n\nHere is a snippet from the log\n\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.NoSuchFieldError: \norg.eclipse.core.internal.boot.DelegatingURLClassLoader: field MONITOR_PLUGINS \nnot found\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.plugins.PluginDescriptor.doPluginActivation\n(PluginDescriptor.java:192)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.plugins.PluginClassLoader.activatePlugin\n(PluginClassLoader.java:59)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.plugins.PluginClassLoader.internalFindClassParentsSelf\n(PluginClassLoader.java:137)",
    "Are you using Core Tools Patch v1.0.1?  This patch is required for running the\ncore performance tools on 2.0.* builds.  It\u0027s available here:\n\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/downloads/tools/core-tools-patch_1.0.1.zip",
    "You asked: Are you using Core Tools Patch v1.0.1?  It is this patch that is the \nproblem. With this patch applied our workbenches won\u0027t start.\n\nI assume that without the patch we won\u0027t be able to use the core performance \ntools. ",
    "What errors do you get in the metadata log file when your workbenches don\u0027t \nstart?",
    "Sorry, what I meant to ask was is the log that you include with or without the \n1.0.1 patch for the resources plug-in.",
    "Note that I installed 2.0.3 + patches + tools and it started ok.",
    "The log snippet that I included in the description, is from the GM version of \nWSAD + 1.0.1 patch + eFix for WSAD.\n\nPerhaps the eFix for WSAD isn\u0027t exactly eclipse 2.0.3, I\u0027m not sure. Update \nManager reports it as Eclipse Platform SDK 2.0.3 ",
    "Closing. We are unable to reproduce this at our end, they work ok for 2.1.3, and\nJeff has modified the Eclipse tools to work in the 3.0 stream.",
    "Cleaning up old defects."
