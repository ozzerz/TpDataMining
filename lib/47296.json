    "I assume you have an old environment that you are upgrading to 3.0M5?\n\nChris, are there issues converting an old workspace to M5?\n\n",
    "Same just happened to me.\nI run Windows2000, but don\u0027t have administrator privileges.\n\nI tried a new installation, without converting any older workspaces.\n ",
    "I have the same problem with WinNT. Either with a new or an old workspace. It\u0027s \nall the same. ",
    "this is very strange. in the M5 build line 517 of KeyStroke is:\nhashCode \u003d hashCode * HASH_FACTOR + modifierKeys.hashCode();\n(to see this, import the workbench plugin as source from the M5 drop..)\n\nthe NullPointerException can only occur when dereferencing the private field \nmodifierKeys, which only is write-accessed once - in the first line of the \nKeyStroke constructor. this first line is guaranteed to return non-null. in \nfact, line 3 of the constructor would throw a NullPointerException if the \nfield was null.\n\nif the stack trace was not complete, and the NullPointerException occured \nfurther down, it would be inside the Set method of hashCode(), which, if you \nfollow through TreeSet, HashSet, and Collections.UnmodifableSortedSet, can not \noccur. (they all eventually get to java.util.AbstractSet.hashCode() which is \nsafe)\n\nif anyone has a different stack trace, or info on their VM, I would appreciate \nit added to this PR.\n\ni\u0027m going to pass this to doug to double-sanity-check this, otherwise should \nclose as \u0027worksforme\u0027\n",
    "Could one of the three people seeing this bug please specify which VM they are \nusing (and version), as well as the specifications of the machine.  Thanks.\n\n\nChris: I don\u0027t think it is a good idea to close this bug, even if we don\u0027t \nknow what\u0027s wrong.  There are three separate people who have reported this \nproblem.\n\n\nIn an extremely unlikely case, I think it is possible for this error to occur \nif two separate threads were trying to access the key stroke at the same \ntime.  But, I think it would require a multi-processor machine, which the \nfirst person specifically says they don\u0027t have.  And, I didn\u0027t think this \nsection of code was multi-threaded.  However, if one thread constructed the \nkey stroke and another asked for that stroke\u0027s hash code, I believe it might \nbe possible that write re-ordering performed by the memory bus could cause a \nNullPointerException.\n\nSeems far-fetched, hunh?\n",
    "i don\u0027t think that makes sense. KeyStroke has no super. Constructor finishes \nbefore initial reference is assigned to variable. (the \u0027x\u0027 in this expression:\nx \u003d KeyStroke.getInstance(..).\n\nanother thread cannot get access to this variable to call hashCode() until the \ninitial reference is available, after which point the field modifierKeys is \nnot mutable.\n\ni noticed some activity on eclipse-dev about incorrect debug information \nbetween source and class in M5. i think it possible that we have a case of \nthis.\n",
    "I must confess that my knowledge of this is a bit shaky, but I\u0027m not entirely \nsure that you\u0027re right.  Of course, if this class isn\u0027t be accessed by \nmultiple threads, then re-ordering of memory access wouldn\u0027t make a difference.\n\nStuff to look at: \n\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/memory.doc.html#30206\" \n\"http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/cpj/jmm.html\"\n\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/jmm.pdf\"\n\nBut, as I said, I don\u0027t really understand this topic all that well.",
