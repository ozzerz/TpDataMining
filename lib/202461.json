    "Using subclipse 1.2.4 on Eclipse 3.3.\nI had a feature project that was connected to an svn repository already.\nI copy/pasted the project to get a copy.\nI then selected the new project and executed Team\u003eDisconnect.\nThat\u0027s when I hit the error being submitted.\n\nThe error shows a stacktrace only in team provider code thats why I\u0027m not submitting to subclipse for now.\n\n-- Error Log --\nDate: Thu Sep 06 10:24:28 EDT 2007\nMessage: An internal error occurred during: \"Updating Synchronize view for SVNStatusSubscriber.\".\nSeverity: Error\nPlugin ID: org.eclipse.core.jobs\nStack Trace:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.subscribers.SubscriberEventHandler.processEvent(SubscriberEventHandler.java:332)\nat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.BackgroundEventHandler.processEvents(BackgroundEventHandler.java:369)\nat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.BackgroundEventHandler$1.run(BackgroundEventHandler.java:203)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)",
    "Subclipse is not provided by Eclipse. You should inform the provider of the plug-in about this issue.",
    "Even with the given stack trace purely in team code?",
    "The reality is that we have get many bug reports that don\u0027t involve third party code that we can\u0027t really hope to address issues that do. One option would be to try and reproduce the failure using CVS. If the same problem occurs with CVS, you can reopen the bug. If it doesn\u0027t, then the problem is somehow related to something specific that Subclipse is doing."
