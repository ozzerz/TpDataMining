    "The log shows that Annie\u0027s checkout had a username of \"sername\". I suspect  \nthat this is indicative of a problem in the options processing. \n \nThere\u0027s a second problem here, which is that the server stopped. This may  \nhave been caused by the auth failure. (It may also be a HUP glitch, since \nI was running the server under my UID, not root.) I\u0027ll look into the crash \nproblem, but I think the options processing stuff is clearly in Dave\u0027s \nterritory. \n ",
    "On attempting to reproduce, I realized that the \"-username\" only had one  \ndash, and so was correctly being interpreted as \"-u\". Thus, no bug here.  \n  \nThe server stop was a HUP, due to running the server manually from a non-root  \naccount. Annie\u0027s second login crashed with a null pointer because my logout \ntook down the server in the middle of her login. \n \nUnfortunately, because this is assigned to Dave, I can\u0027t mark it resolved.
