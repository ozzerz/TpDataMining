(More early next week). \n\nTake care \nJohn \n\n\n \"Sarkar, Sumit\" \u003csumit.sarkar@hp.com\u003e 05/07/2004 12:02 PM \n         \n        To:        John Wiegand/Minneapolis/IBM@IBMUS \n        cc:        \"Sarkar, Sumit\" \u003csumit.sarkar@hp.com\u003e, \"Perot, Florence C\"\n\u003cflorence.perot@hp.com\u003e \n        Subject:        submitting patches for ia64 platform \n\n\n\n\nHi  John, \n  \nWe had  downloaded \"eclipse-sourceBuild-srcIncluded-I20040505.zip\", built \nand tested our  changes and we are confident about our changes. \n  \nI am  attaching 5 patch files with this mail as a patches_ia64.zip.  \nThe contents of the patches_ia64.zip file: \n\n1. platform-launcher_ia64.patch: In \"platform-launcher/library/motif\"\n        a. Changed build.csh to take care of both  PA_RISC and ia64 architecture\n        b. Renamed make_hpux.mak to  make_hpux_PA_RISC.mak \n        c. Created a new makefile for ia64 named  make_hpux_ia64.mak \n        d. As we need to support both PA_RISC and  ia64, we need two folders \n           named  platform-launcher/bin/hpux/PA_RISC and  \n           platform-launcher/bin/hpux/ia64. Right now hpux  PA_RISC \u0027eclipse\u0027 \n           binary is under platform-launcher/bin/hpux folder. This  binary has \n           to be moved to platform-launcher/bin/hpux/PA_RISC folder. The new  \n           eclipse binary for ia64 has to be under platform-launcher/bin/hpux/ia64  \n           folder. But as these folders didn\u0027t have any files under them \n           \u0027Team -\u003e  Create Patch\u0027 didn\u0027t include these folder into this patch. \n           Should you think  it is a good idea to check in initial versions of \n           ia64 eclipse binary, I  have attached another patch \n           (under  platform-launcher_with_eclipse_binaries.zip) -  which has \n           PA_RISC eclipse binary moved under PA_RISC folder and our initial  \n           ia64 eclipse binary under ia64 folder.\n           \n2. org.eclipse.swt.motif_ia64.patch: In  \"org.eclipse.swt.motif\":\n        a. Updated  permission.properties to take care of both PA_RISC  \n           and ia64 library names \n        b. Need a folder named \u0027os.hpux.ia64\u0027 - but as  when there is no \n           file under it, \u0027Team -\u003e Create Patch\u0027 doesn\u0027t include  the folder \n           into this patch. Should you think it is a good idea to check in  \n           initial versions of our shared libraries \n           (libswt-cde-motif-3050.so and  libswt-motif-3050.so) under \n           \"os.hpux.ia64\", I am attaching those libraries  \n           (zipped as SWT_motif_ia64_libraries.zip) also  with this mail. \n           This way the folder will appear in CVS and we can later  \n           check in the final version easily.  \n           \n3. org.eclipse.swt_ia64.patch: In \"org.eclipse.swt.Eclipse  SWT PI\" folder\n        a. Changed build.sh to take care of both  PA_RISC and ia64 architecture \n        b. Renamed make_hpux.mak to  make_hpux_PA_RISC.mak \n        c. Created a new makefile for ia64 named  make_hpux_ia64.mak \n        d. Made changes to make_motif.xml to take care  of both PA_RISC and \n           ia64 architecture (don\u0027t know how this file is  used) \n           \n4. org.eclipse.osgi_ia64.patch: In  \"org.eclipse.osgi\", two .java file changes \n   to add ia64  architecture \n   \n5. org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility_ia64.patch: \n   In org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility\", one .java file change to add ia64\n architecture\n\nI am  working with DJ Houghton to commit the org.eclipse.core.resources.hpux \nchanges. \n  \nPl.  let me know if you any questions regarding this matter. \n  \nThanks, \nsumit",

    "Hi John/Christophe/Sonia,\n\nI think this is the time to get some traction on the 3.1 port on hpux ia64. I\ncreated the \"org.eclipse.swt.motif.hpux.ia64\" project and want to contribute\nback.

    "Hi Sumit,\n\nI am taking over this item from Christophe for the SWT team.  please forgive \nme if you have already had this discussion but I have some questions about \nthis port.\n\nSWT does not currently support a 64 bit version of motif, there are \nassumptions about pointer lengths etc in our code.  Are you running in 32 bit \nmode on the IA64 machine?",
    "Hi Veronika,\n\nEclipse will be running in 32-bit mode on the IA64 machine.\n\nPl. let me know when you are done creating the project.\n\nThanks,\nsumit",
    "We need to come up with the correct name for the architecture.  \"ia64\" implies \nthat you are running in 64 bit mode and we should reserve the name \norg.eclipse.swt.motif.hpux.ia64 for a possible future 64 bit port of motif.  \nWhat does the OS use on the platform for the 32 bit version of the libraries? \nWhat does the VM report for:\n\nSystem.out.println(System.getProperty(\"os.arch\"));\n",
    "System.out.println(System.getProperty(\"os.arch\")) prints \"IA64N\" for 32-bit\njava. For 64-bit, HP uses \"IA64W\" as the architecture string. \"N\" is for 32-bit\nand \"W\" (Wide) for 64-bit. For now (32-bit) we can use\n\"org.eclipse.swt.motif.hpux.ia64\" for the 32-bit SWT project name. In future, we\nmay want to use \"org.eclipse.swt.motif.hpux.ia64w\" for the 64-bit port. That\nwill be inlined with the HP terminology. \"uname -a\" returns the \"ia64\" as the\narchitecture in HP-UX IA64 machine. We have made contribution to Eclipse and we\nuse \"-arch\" as \"ia64\" for the IA64 port. \n\nThanks,\nsumit",
    "I think the 32-bit SWT project name should be org.eclipse.swt.motif.hpux.ia64n.\n\nWe already have an ia64 project for GTK 64 bit mode which is \norg.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.ia64 and in this case ia64 really means 64 bit \nmode.  We need to be consistent in our naming convention.\n\nWe would need to introduce -arch ia64n.",
