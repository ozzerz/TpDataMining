    "I20060627-1200 (and earlier)\n\nNot sure whether this is of any interest to you - feel free to close if not.\n\nI copied my entire installation to a new PC. Everything is identical (directory structure, file system, etc.). I was able to start most of my workspaces on the cloned machine, but not my standard head workspace. There, the core.resources plug-in fails to load with an exception very similar to the ones in bug 38682:\n\norg.eclipse.core.internal.dtree.ObjectNotFoundException: Tree element ...bin/.../Someclass.class not found.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.dtree.AbstractDataTree.handleNotFound(AbstractDataTree.java:243)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.dtree.DeltaDataTree.getData(DeltaDataTree.java:608)\n...\n(stack trace made up)\n\nI was able to recover by deleting .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.snap.\n\nI believe I can reproduce the problem by copying the workspace from the original machine. If you are interested, I could provide the workspace in some form, or provide access to my machine for debugging... If not - fine with me. I know copying workspaces is not exactly supported."
