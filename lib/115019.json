    "There are issues in the API and documentation relating to the use of the marker \nextension point \"org.eclipse.core.resources.markers\", used in conjuction with \nIFile.createMarker().\n\n* If the marker extension is misconfigured through (a) invalid marker \nsupertype, or (b) wrong name passed to IFile.createMarker(MARKER_TYPE), the \nprimary sympton a developer sees is:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\tat \norg.eclipse.ui.texteditor.MarkerUtilities$MarkerTypeHierarchy.appendAll\n(MarkerUtilities.java:84) at \norg.eclipse.ui.texteditor.MarkerUtilities$MarkerTypeHierarchy.computeSuperTypes\n(MarkerUtilities.java:67)\n\nNow, those two mistakes are pretty common and easy to make - a more informative \nerror response would greatly assist resolution of the issue. For example, it \nhas taken me 6 hours of painstaking debugging and reading to identify the \nunderlying config problem.\n\nI am not alone -  a search of the site reveals at least 2 precedents with the \nsame sympton and cause:\n\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg16086.html\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/newslists/news.eclipse.platform/msg44801.html\n\n* It was not at obvious what the correct value for marker type should be. The \njavadoc for createMarker() says \"Marker type ids are the id of an extension \ninstalled in the org.eclipse.core.resources.markers extension point.\" Now my \nrelevant plugin.xml looks like this:\n\n\u003cextension id\u003d\"JavacBuilder.javacProblem\" ...\n\nso you might reasonably conclude from the above info that MARKER_TYPE should \nbe \"JavacBuilder.javacProblem\". However, only by introspecting a running \nEclipse instance did I discover that it actually needed to \nbe \"JavaBuilder.JavacBuilder.javacProblem\". \n\nProbably, it *is* documented somewhere, but I should get some better indication \nof my natural mistake than a NPE in some list append code.\n\n* There is no \"Fail-fast\" indication of the problem during the call to \nIFile.createMarker(), which succeeds without issue, rather the failure happens \nin another thread, complicating the issue. Perhaps some validation of the \nmarker type at creation time is warranted...?",

    "This is already fixed in the 3.2 stream."
