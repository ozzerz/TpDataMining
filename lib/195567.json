    "As discussed in newsgroup postings:\n\n----------------------------------------\nHello,\n\nI\u0027m using eclipse 3.3 with wtp 2.0 to create some simple jsf-pages.\nThe project simply consists of login.jsp and welcome.jsp following the JSF tutorial here on eclipse.org.\n\nI\u0027ve added the web.xml and faces-config.xml generated for my JBOSS 4.2 installation below.\n\nWhen I deploy the application and request the login.jsp from my browser (firefox) then JBOSS gets in an infinite loop. The server.log shows these entries: 2007-07-01 18:05:30,859 ERROR [org.apache.catalina.core.ContainerBase.[jboss.web].[localhost].[/JBossTestWeb].[Faces Servlet]] Servlet.service() for servlet Faces Servlet threw exception\njava.lang.StackOverflowError\nat javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper.getSession(HttpServletRequestWrapper.java:216)\nat org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationHttpRequest.getSession(ApplicationHttpRequest.java:545)\nat javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequestWrapper.getSession(HttpServletRequestWrapper.java:216)\nat org.apache.catalina.core.ApplicationHttpRequest.getSession(ApplicationHttpRequest.java:545)\n\n... The two last lines repeating itself.\n\nWhat have I done wrong?\n\nWith kind regards\nFlorian Reiser\n----------------------------------------\nHello,\n\nI\u0027ve found my error.\nThe infinite recursion happened because of my Faces servlet-mapping to *.jsp\nWhen changing it to *.jsf, everything worked fine.\n\nThere should be some comment, that you have to create the jsf-pages as *.jsp-files and access them via the *.jsf-mapping.\nMy mistake was to believe that the files have to have the same extension as the mapping suggests.\n\nWith kind regards\nFlorian Reiser\n----------------------------------------\nThis is a case of several configurations creating a condition where an infinite loop is entered (as you have discovered). By default, when extension mapping is used, FacesServlet looks for a corresponding resource with a \".jsp\" extension. But this can be configured differently by using a context-param. Also, by default, a JSP engine will have the \".jsp\" extension configured such that before the resource is returned to the client, servlet-mappings will be consulted to see if the resource needs to be passed to any servlet. This too can be configured in at least some JSP engines. The JSF Tooling can\u0027t inspect the runtime engine to determine its configuration to see if this condition will definitely occur (although it\u0027s likely to occur unless defaults are changed).\n\nThis is more of a general servlet engine configuration and JSF web application configuration issue than it is a specific JSF Tooling issue. That said, it\u0027s not a highly-improbable condition to encounter, so if you\u0027d like to make an enhancement request for JSF Tooling, please log an issue in Bugzilla (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product\u003dJava%20Server%20Faces).\n\n(Posted by Ian Trimble, Oracle, JSF Tools Project)\n----------------------------------------\nHello Ian,\n\nI don\u0027t think that is an issue severe enough to write an issue request.\nIt would only be kind to explain this to newcomers in the tutorial.\nWould you mind to include the content of your post in the tutorial?\n\nWith kind regards\nFlorian Reiser"
