Does work ok on the \u0027request\u0027 part.",
    "Oh, I meant to say I observed this using M20050921 with a \"3.1.1  base\". \n\n\nThere was no messages in log associated with making the content assist request, \nbut at some point, the following was printed to log: (We shold probably not \nlog \"operation canceled\" ... I think that\u0027s a normal message). \n\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui 4 4 2005-09-21 09:07:32.358\n!MESSAGE problem with as-you-type validation\n!STACK 0\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.OperationCanceledException\n        at org.eclipse.wst.sse.ui.internal.reconcile.DirtyRegionProcessor.run(Di\nrtyRegionProcessor.java:411)\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:76)",
    "I tried on a fresh install with M20050923 and could not reproduce. \nI tried with that M build installed on a 3.1.1 base and installed on a \n3.1 base. \n\nSo .. not sure if a fluke of my one particular install, or a fluke \nof exactly how M builds compiled (I think 9/23 builds have true 3.1.1 \nJDT compiler?) ... but in either case, I do not think this requires \nany further investigation or fixes. \n",
