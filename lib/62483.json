    "While testing the cheat sheets for resource leaks, I discovered that \nFormToolkit.dispose() is called multiple times. As a result, an NPE occurs.\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n     at org.eclipse.ui.forms.widgets.FormToolkit.dispose(FormToolkit.java:568)\n\nThe NPE should be easy to fix but another thing to note is that FormToolkit \ndoes not from an isDisposed() method. I\u0027m not sure if it is actually required \nbut calls of dispose() have no clue if someone sharing the same toolkit have \nalready called it.",
    "Lorne, toolkits are not supposed to be shared. Toolkits can share colors (this \nproperty is already managed i.e. a toolkit that has been passed a FormColors \nobject will not dispose it), but the toolkit itself is not shareable. It \nshould map 1-\u003e1 with some disposable entity (a view or an editor) and be \ndisposed with it.",
    "Dejan, I agree with your comments and discovered that it was a bug in a local \nchange that I was testing. Oops! :-) "
