    "I started AC TPTP-4.4.0-200705310943 on Linux RH running in 32bit mode and tried to start profiling remotely from Windows Server 2003-IA32 machine. Test of connection was successful. I selected \u0027JRE-1.5 or new\u0027/\u0027Therad analysis\u0027 profiler. After pressing \u0027Profile\u0027 button AC crashed with diagnostics:\n\n# An unexpected error has been detected by HotSpot Virtual Machine:\n#\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc\u003d0xb6f9ce33, pid\u003d4437, tid\u003d2250607536\n#\n# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (1.5.0_09-b03 mixed mode)\n# Problematic frame:\n# C  [libtptpCmdExtr.so+0x4e33]  parseMessage+0x10b\n#\n# An error report file with more information is saved as hs_err_pid4437.log\n#\n# If you would like to submit a bug report, please visit:\n#   http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport/crash.jsp\n#\n\nThis crash is not stable.

    "I successfully launched profiling session on remote RH Linux from Windows Server.\nViacheslav, what RH are you using?",
    "I use RH3\n\n$uname -a\nLinux lab12 2.4.21-4.ELsmp #1 SMP Fri Oct 3 17:52:56 EDT 2003 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n",

    "I\u0027m able to reproduce the issue on other Linux machine. I tried SUSE9:\n$uname -a\nLinux lab1 2.6.5-7.97-bigsmp #1 SMP Fri Jul 2 14:21:59 UTC 2004 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux\n\nI reproduced the described crash and exception. Also I was able to start profiling several times. Usually I was getting org.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException.",
    "I tried this this morning with Linux SuSE SLES 9. At first the remote JVMTI profiles were just slow (and sometimes interrupted in the middle such as for StartStop)...but after three profiles I got the same runtime.CoreException as seen above. Sometimes I also don\u0027t get any data (all profiling types, including probekit). ",
    "I have been running into this on EM64T as well but only when I use a SUN JRE. The IBM JRE allows a remote profile. ",
    "I\u0027ve investigated the issue one more time with assistance from Igor.\nHere is my conclusion.\nWhile I was trying to profile remotly at first all AC and JRE binaries were located remotely on file server. I copied these binaries to Linux machine local disk and profiling launcher became faster and connection with AC became more stable. As a result I was able to profiler though some AC failures occurred. In case of localhost profiling if all AC and JRE binaries are local profiler launching works as expected.\nSo it looks like the reason of described failures is inconsistence between AC and the Client internal timeouts and various network delays.",
    "Lowering severity and retargeting to future because:\nWhen all binaries (Eclipse, java, AC) are installed on a local Linux disk, profiling works fine. Problem is encountered with binaries installed on network disk.\n\nSince local installation allows normal functioning of profiler, my understanding is that Viacheslav agrees to the lowering of the severity and to the retarget of this bug to the next release.",
    "It is not reproduced with current build (4.4.1-200709060100).\n",
