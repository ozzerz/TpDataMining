    "Which WTP driver are you using?  We have been doing regular smoke testing of WTP 2.0.2 and 3.0 driver and have no problem creating bottom-up Web service using both Axis1 and Axis2 runtime.  I assume you are using Axis1 Web service runtime (the default)?\n\nIs the Java bean that you are creating a Web service from in a Web project or Java project?  Before you run the Web service wizard, could you please go to the Resource view and verify that the class file is there in the Build/classes directory?  If the class file is not there, that might be the cause of the problem.  You might have run into an intermittent problem where the class file is not refreshed (bug 208614).  If the class file is not there, could you please try to build the project with clean and try again.\n\nAre you able to reproduce this consistently?  If so, can you please provide detail steps of how to reproduce the problem and provide information on the configuration you have?  Thanks!"
