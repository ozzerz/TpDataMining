    "Using WTP 1.5 GM driver, I just tried to install the Geronimo plugin by\nclicking \"Do not see your server listed\" link in Preference -\u003e server -\u003e\ninstall runtime.  The message still indicated Geronimo 1.0 but I think it\u0027s actually the Geronimo 1.1 feature and plugin that\u0027s being refered to (see bug 149354).  The install failed with a message:\n\n!MESSAGE Featureorg.apache.geronimo.feature org.apache.geronimo.featurecannot\nbe found onhttp://apache.sunsite.ualberta.ca/geronimo/eclipse/updates/\nor a newer version is already installed.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.wst.server.core 4 0 2006-07-20 15:40:58.745\n!MESSAGE Error occurred installing server: Could not download and install\nupdate feature.\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Could not download and install update\nfeature.\n at\norg.eclipse.wst.server.core.internal.InstallableServer.install(InstallableServer.java:166)\n at\norg.eclipse.wst.server.ui.internal.wizard.NewInstallableServerWizard$5.run(NewInstallableServerWizard.java:120)\n at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.wst.server.core 4 0 2006-07-20 15:40:58.755\n!MESSAGE Could not download and install update feature.\n\nI can get the the URL:\nonhttp://apache.sunsite.ualberta.ca/geronimo/eclipse/updates/\nusing a browser. \n\nThis link used to be fine when I tried it in WTP 1.5 RC6 timeframe about a\nmonth ago and I was able to install Geronimo 1.0 plugins successfully before.\n\nSachin indicated that it works ok using the update manager, so there\u0027s something\nwrong with either the installable server ext point in wtp, or the installable\nserver code.",
    "We need this fixed in WTP 1.5.1.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d46642)\npatch for problem\n\nThis patches fixes the issue as there was a bug in the getLatestVersion method, I also changed the implementation to rid of the use of the deprecated PluginVersionIdentifier and used scrictly the Version class",
    "Hi Tim,\n\nNot sure if you get CCed automatically as component lead.  Please commit Sachin\u0027s patch at your earliest convenience.  Thanks!",
    "Note from Kathy:\n\u003e Would it be possible for you to review and commit the patch Sachin provide for defect 151403 for this week\u0027s WTP 1.5.1 I-build?\n\u003e It\u0027s holding up a few of our FVT test cases.\n\nYes, it\u0027s already in HEAD and on track for this week\u0027s I-build.",
    "Released for the next WTP 1.5.1 \u0026 2.0 builds.",
    "Verified on WTP 1.5.1 200609220504.  Thanks Tim!",
    "Closing.",
    "This is part of a \"mass update\" where bugs showing \"fixed\" between 7/1/2006 and 9/27/2006 are assumed fixed in WTP 1.5.1. feel free to change the target milestone if you know a more accurate setting. "
