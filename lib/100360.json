    "Hello,\n\nENV: Eclipse 3.0.2 (same happens with 3.1RC2) on both WinXP and Win2K.\n\nI\u0027m having huge problems trying to synchronize to a cvs repository running CVS \n1.11.1p1 on a Linux RHAS2.1, using SSH2.\n\nI don\u0027t know whether this has anything to do with bug #15490 (multiple cvs \ncommands on a single connection) but surely the two have the \"i/o broken pipe \nerror\" in common...\n\nthis is what I get when I do a \"Team-\u003eSynchronize\" :\n\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.core 4 0 2005-06-16 09:46:07.218\n!MESSAGE Problems reported while synchronizing CVS Workspace. 0 of 1 resources \nwere synchronized.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.core 4 0 2005-06-16 09:46:07.218\n!MESSAGE An error occurred synchronizing /WS Spine: I/O exception occurred: \nPipe broken\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSCommunicationException[0]: \njava.io.IOException: Pipe broken\n\tat java.io.PipedInputStream.read(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.io.PipedInputStream.read(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.io.FilterInputStream.read(Unknown Source)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream.readUntilDone\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:269)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream.runThread\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:218)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream.access$0\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:216)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream$1.run\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:65)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 0 2005-06-16 09:46:07.218\n!MESSAGE I/O exception occurred: Pipe broken\n!STACK 0\njava.io.IOException: Pipe broken\n\tat java.io.PipedInputStream.read(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.io.PipedInputStream.read(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.io.FilterInputStream.read(Unknown Source)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream.readUntilDone\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:269)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream.runThread\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:218)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream.access$0\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:216)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.core.streams.TimeoutInputStream$1.run\n(TimeoutInputStream.java:65)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n\n\nPlease note that I didn\u0027t have any problems checking out the projects from the \nrepository... \nI don\u0027t have any problem either when I commit a single file\n\nAny ideas?\n\nThank you very much,\nPaolo",
    "We\u0027ve seen this before but have never been able to reproduce it reliably. I \nsuspect that is has to do with concurrency problems in PipedInputStream. What \nJVM are you using? Ymnk, have you seen similar problems using JSch outside of \nEclipse?",
    "\nHi Michael,\n\nI\u0027m using JVM 1.5.0_1 \n\nAs you already pointed out it\u0027s not easy to reproduce the bug.\nSo far it has caused me problems in (about) 50% of the cases.\n\nCheers,\nPaolo\n\n",
    "[workaround]\n\nHi again,\n\nthis is weird... It seems the problem has got something to do with closing the \nteam-sync perspective.\n\n1) (with team synchronize window closed) I select the project and do a Team-\n\u003eSync\n2) Eclipse tries to sync with the remote repository but gets stuck. Eventually \nI get a broken pipe (or connection reset by peer) error.\n3) I close the team sync perspective.\n\nIf I go 1-\u003e2-\u003e3 again I get the same error, *BUT* if I don\u0027t close the team \nsync perspective after the broken pipe and try to resync again (either by \npressing F5 in the team perspective window or by doing team-\u003esync) it works! (I \ndon\u0027t get the error!)\n\nI know it\u0027s not a fix... but maybe it can help other people ;)\n\nThanks \nPaolo\n\n\n\n",
    "I don\u0027t know if this is the cause or not, but when searching for a solution to\nthis problem (which I had recently and persistently), I found this bug in\nanother list.  Hope this helps.\n\nhttp://mail-index.netbsd.org/netbsd-bugs/2004/01/26/0011.html\nSynopsis:       broken pipe race condition in CVS pserver\nDescription:\n\tThere is a race condition in the CVS pserver code that\n\tcauses CVS ops to abort with the \"broken pipe\" error message.\n\tWhat happens is the parent CVS process tries to tell the\n\tchild to stop by writing a \"S\" to its flow control pipe.\n\tHowever, the child may already be dead and its read pipe\n\tis therefore closed.  This happens when there is enough\n\toutstanding data in the kernel socket buffers not yet read\n\tby the parent process when the child exits.  The master\n\treads this data in and tries to send a message on its\n\tflowcontrol pipe to stop, but its flowcontrol pipe is\n\talready closed and the kernel sends a SIGPIPE to the parent\n\tPID.\n",
