    "i am totally befuddled as to how to set up a data source. \n\ni have a freshly installed eclipse 3.1M4, wtp-1.0M2, wtp-wst-1.0M2 etc, and a\nfreshly installed Tomcat 5.0, all running under windows xp. within this setting,\ni have tried to install an existing web application that works fine under\n\"plain\" eclipse and resin, and also runs fine under websphere 4. the application\nruns fine, but can\u0027t access its (oracle) data sources.\n\nmy problem: i have no idea how and where to specify the data sources. i have tried\n - using the tomcat administration web application\n - (TOMCAT-INSTALL-DIR)/conf/server.xml \n - (TOMCAT-INSTALL-DIR)/conf/Catalina/localhost/(myappname).xml\n - the server.xml that can be seen in the J2EE perspective, under Servers (along\nwith 3 other files), with diverse combinations of the preferences settings\n\"Automaticall publish before starting servers\" and \"Create server resources in\nworkspace\"\n\nwhat happens is \n... the tomcat administration application loses the jndi resources\nafter a server restart.  \n... the tomcat-conf/ files seem to get overwritten \nfrom time to time (not exactly sure when). \n... the server-view server.xml does \nnot seem to do anything. \nthe debugging process is nearly impossible, as there is absolutely no \nfeedback as to the reason why the configuration doesn\u0027t work; all i \never get is the stack trace info:\n\n- got a NamingException when trying to fetch DataSource using jndi\n\u0027java:comp/env/jdbc/mmdb\u0027: javax.naming.NamingException: Cannot create resource\ninstance\njavax.naming.NamingException: Cannot create resource instance\n\tat\norg.apache.naming.factory.ResourceFactory.getObjectInstance(ResourceFactory.java:132)\n\tat javax.naming.spi.NamingManager.getObjectInstance(NamingManager.java:301)\n\tat org.apache.naming.NamingContext.lookup(NamingContext.java:791)\n\nI imagine that this kind of problem happens to most people that try \nto deploy an application that uses JNDI database pools; so there should \nbe some kind of how-to documentation for such cases, or a list of tips. \nthe only thing i found was\n\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/newsportal/article.php?id\u003d1753\u0026group\u003declipse.webtools\n\nwhich was quite interesting, but did not lead to success.",
    "Not sure this is a rdb defect.",
    "Fixed. Category name is now \"Data\".",
    "Resolved by mistake.",
    "Hi Larry,\n   Since you indicated that this defect was fixed in comment #3 I\u0027m assigning \nthis defect over to you.\n\n   Thanks.",
    "This should not be on the web services component. Changing component back to \nwst.rdb. If this also isn\u0027t the correct component, I suggest assigning to Web \nStandard Tools so that somebody in the architecture group and reroute it \nappropriately.",
    "I\u0027m not sure which component this belongs to so assigning to Web Standard Tools.",
    "As this bug talks about problems with the config files I\u0027m assigning to the JST server component.\n\nTake note, this bug is very old and may or may not be a problem in WTP 1.5.",
    "To edit the Tomcat configuration files you need to edit the copies within the Server project in your workspace. This allows you to version and control the files within WTP, and they are published out to Tomcat (possibly overwriting the existing copy, depending on your configuration options) during publish.",
    "Closing old bugs."
