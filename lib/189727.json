    "Version: 3.3.0\nBuild id: I20070529-0010\n\nIf you create a plug-in project and agree to switch perspectives the dialog will not go away and cannot be closed. You will have to kill Eclipse to continue.\n\nSTEPS\n1) Open the java perspective\n2) Create a plug-in project\n3) Agree to switch perspectives \n4) Dialog will not go away",
    "Note that this is not happening with similar operations like switching to the Team Synch perspective when synching",
    "any logs?  Also, can you try to switch to the Plug-ins Perspective before creating a project?  Might tell us if it is a problem with the perspective or with the plug-in project creation.",
    "Bug reproduced on Vista.\n\nRE:  Comment #1\n\nHi Tod,\n\nAlthough I have not used a WPF build before, this one seems slightly unstable.\n\nI tried opening the \"CVS Repositories\" view using the \"Show View\" dialog and got the following error in my log:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException\nat org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.ShowViewDialog.saveWidgetValues(ShowViewDialog.java:349)\nat org.eclipse.ui.internal.dialogs.ShowViewDialog.doubleClick(ShowViewDialog.java:261)\nat org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredViewer$1.run(StructuredViewer.java:799)\n\nUsing the \"CVS Repositories\" perspective, I checked out \"org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets\" into my workspace and then synchronized the plug-in with the repository.  The \"Confirm Open Perspective\" dialog opened up and after two seconds another dialog opened as well saying \"Synchronizing CVS: No changes found\".  Switching to the \"Team Synchronizing\" perspective is okay; but, the second dialog cannot be cleared resulting in the same problem as the PDE dialog.\n\nAre you seeing this too?  Did you want me to open up bug reports?  I have a feeling this problem may be a WPF / SWT specific problem.\n\nRE:  Comment #2\n\nNothing in log.\nSwitching to Plug-in Development perspective beforehand works fine.\nWill try to debug and isolate what exactly is going wrong.\n",
    "The hanging dialog is not owned by PDE and is generated by specifying the\nfinalPerspective attribute in org.eclipse.ui.newWizards wizard element:\n\n      \u003cwizard\n            ...\n            id\u003d\"org.eclipse.pde.ui.NewProjectWizard\"\u003e\n            finalPerspective\u003d\"org.eclipse.pde.ui.PDEPerspective\"\n         ...\n      \u003c/wizard\u003e\n      \nI swapped the PDEPerspective value with org.eclipse.ui.resourcePerspective\nand the hanging dialog resulted still.\n\nIt appears that our project creation operation is fine and the PDE perspective\nis opened properly as well.\n\nAs a result, I am punting this one over to Platform UI to investigate \nfurther.  If it turns out to a be a PDE issue, please send back.\n\n",
    "The problem you are mentioning is unrelated - please log a bug."
