Press OK.\nNote how the item gets added to the list, but it\u0027s not selected.\n\nIt should be automatically selected so that the \u0027remove\u0027 button gets enabled without the user having to do anything.\n\nSubsequent additions do exhibit the correct behaviour.",
    "assigning to Sean and cc Mike to review/release the patch.",
    "Sean, while you\u0027re at it:\nThe three table viewers on the Dependencies page of the editor as well as the Exported packages section on the Runtime page also have the same problem.\n",
    "Mike, same with addition of a plug-in in the \u0027Required Plug-ins\u0027 section and the one below it.  Nothing gets selected after addition.\n\nGiven that the order of plug-ins in these two sections matters, we should do what we do in the cheatsheet editor and insert after the current selection.  Currently, it always goes at the end.",
    "The last bit (re ordering) is for extra credit only.",
    "Re-re-assigning to Noam.  Mike, please review.",
    "This one may be \"too hard\" for bugday, as Noam would say.  We have had two people take a crack at it, and no success.",
    "I hear that Peter Friese guy is pretty smart though ;)",
    "It may need to be split into multiple bugs; it doesn\u0027t look like there is any way to fix it in the general case. Just guessing from my last glance at it (pre-TOC editor!) we would have to fix each of the affected lists on a case-by-case basis.",
    "I agree with Intern.",
    "Are you screwing around Noam?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d77178)\nPatch for bug 171896.\n\nThis fix affects the Execution Environment section (Overview page), the Imported Packages section (Dependencies page), and the Exported Packages section (Runtime page).\n\nProblems still persist in these sections:\n- Package Visibility (Eclipse 3.1 or Later)\n- Required Plug-ins\n- Library Visibility (Eclipse 3.0)\n- Automated Management of Dependencies\n\nSince each of these sections requires some more complex work for proper selection behaviour on insertions (for example, Package Visibility never selects an added element), we should open separate bugs for each of the sections.\n\nThe ordering issue in comment 3 should also be opened as a separate bug.",
    "Opened bugs against these sections:\n- Package Visibility (Eclipse 3.1 or Later) (bug 201572)\n- Required Plug-ins (bug 201575)\n- Library Visibility (Eclipse 3.0) (bug 201578)\n- Automated Management of Dependencies (bug 201580)\n\nFor the issue in comment 3, I opened bug 201582.\n\nPerhaps, now that the issues are separated, the bugs can each be considered for bugday. Chris, I\u0027ll leave that up to you.",
    "sure, this can serve as an example for the other bugs as long as we point back to this bug.",
    "Hi Noam, the patch is out of sync with HEAD.  Can you synchronize and reupload?  Thanks.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d77269)\nPatch for bug 171896. (Re-synced)\n\nDone.",
    "(From update of attachment 77269)\nEncountered an exception and has some style issues.  Details to follow.",
    "Style Problems\n\nAlthough selecting the last element in the viewer works, it would be better to set the selection using the changed object within the event (even though its the wrong event).  This can be done directly with the execution environment and you should be able to get at the import and export packages through the manifest header stored in the event.\n\nFunctional Problem\n\nUsing \u0027org.eclipse.pde\u0027, I tried to add the one and only \u0027org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.content\u0027 package to the \u0027Exported Packages\u0027 section and I got the following exception:\n\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.AssertionFailedException: null argument:\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isNotNull(Assert.java:84)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isNotNull(Assert.java:72)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredSelection.\u003cinit\u003e(StructuredSelection.java:66)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.plugin.ExportPackageSection.modelChanged(ExportPackageSection.java:523)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.text.AbstractEditingModel.fireModelChanged(AbstractEditingModel.java:227)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.text.AbstractEditingModel.fireModelObjectChanged(AbstractEditingModel.java:234)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.text.bundle.Bundle.setHeader(Bundle.java:116)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.plugin.ExportPackageSection.handleAdd(ExportPackageSection.java:487)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.plugin.ExportPackageSection.buttonSelected(ExportPackageSection.java:403)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.TableSection$PartAdapter.buttonSelected(TableSection.java:45)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.parts.SharedPartWithButtons$SelectionHandler.buttonSelected(SharedPartWithButtons.java:35)\n\tat org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.parts.SharedPartWithButtons$SelectionHandler.widgetSelected(SharedPartWithButtons.java:28)\n\n\n\n\n",
    "In the Exported Packages section, I tried to alter selection before refresh instead of after. My mistake. :)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d77292)\nPatch for bug 171896.\n\nNow with 100% less exception!\n\nAs for the style issues, while I do agree with Mike, we\u0027ve both taken a look at the model and getting at these elements wouldn\u0027t be worth the effort. I added a null guard, but aside from that I haven\u0027t changed how the last element in the table is located.",
    "(From update of attachment 77292)\nTested well.  Thanks Noam.",
    "Patch released to HEAD.\n\nTarget:  3.4 M2"
