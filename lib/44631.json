    "in SWT 2.1.1 (all platforms, I assume): java.lang.NullPointerException at \norg.eclipse.swt.custom.TableTreeEditor$2.run(TableTreeEditor.java:100)\n\nThis is a very reproducable, and annoying NPE.\n\nfinal Runnable runnable \u003d new Runnable() {\n public void run() {\n  if (TableTreeEditor.this.tableTree.isDisposed() || editor \u003d\u003d null) return;\n  resize();\n  editor.setVisible(true);\n }\n};\n\nI haven\u0027t tried 3.0, but it looks to be still there (unless you are sure \neditor \u003d\u003d null before tableTree \u003d null...):\n\n3.0: \n\nfinal Runnable runnable \u003d new Runnable() {\n      public void run() {\n        if (editor \u003d\u003d null || editor.isDisposed()) return;\n        if (TableTreeEditor.this.tableTree.isDisposed()) return;\n        resize();\n        editor.setVisible(true);\n      }\n    };\n\n\n\nThis fixes it for me in 2.1.1:\n\nif (TableTreeEditor.this.tableTree \u003d\u003d null || \nTableTreeEditor.this.tableTree.isDisposed() || editor \u003d\u003d null) return;",
    "TableTree and TableTreeEditor are deprecated and should not be used.",
    "This change was already made a while ago and this bug should have been closed as FIXED."
