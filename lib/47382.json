    "I\u0027ve been working with E3.0-M5 for the past three days and I have experienced\na lot of errors when using CVS.  With my previous version, E2.1.0, I had no such\nproblems.  \n\n  For example, when attempting to do a Override and Update on a folder several\ntimes I received this error:\n\nAn internal error occurred during: \"Performing CVS operation on \u003cXX\u003e resources.\".\nReason:\n An internal error occurred during: \"Performing CVS operation on \u003cXX\u003e resources.\".\n\n  I have attempted to update some of my apache jakarta projects and have\nreceived errors like:\n\nProblem creating folder:\n/jakarta-jetspeed/src/java/org/apache/jetspeed/om/dbpsml/map.  A resource\nalready exists on disk\n/home/greno/projects/workspace/jakarta-jetspeed/src/java/org/apache/jetspeed/om/dbpsml/map.\n\n  I have attempted to repeat the update attempt and everytime I get an error\nsuch as above except for a different directory.  I still haven\u0027t managed to get\na good update run.  Again everything worked fine under E2.1.0.  \n\n  Again, multiple times while attempting to synchronize some of my projects with\nthe CVS repository I get this error:\n\nAn error occured while synchronizing with remote contents.\n  An error occurred refreshing {0}: {1}/jakarta-jetspeed.ctma.war.jsupgradeThe\nserver reported an error while performing the \"cvs status\" command.\n\n\n  For me, CVS is critical.  I haven\u0027t noticed anything else with M5 but then\nagain, I\u0027ve been spending most of my time dealing with these CVS issues.\n\nGerry Reno",
    "Typically when an internal error occurrs, additional information is writen to \nthe log file. Is there anything in the log file (.metadata/.log inside your \nworkspace directory)?\n\nActually, after a quick look at the info you provided, it appears that one of \nyour files ends in a period (map.). It is possible that this is causing the \nproblem. We\u0027ve seen problems her before and fixed them but perhaps we\u0027ve \nregressed.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d6946)\nE3-M5 log showing CVS problems\n",
    "Ignore my last comment about the file ending in period. It is actually the \nsentence that ends in a period (duh). \n\nThere also appears to be several problems in the log:\n\nProblem 1) It looks like the sync problem is due to the inabiliy to create a \nread lock on the server. The following message (and several others from the \nserver) were logged in several cases:\n\njakarta-jetspeed.ctma.war.jsupgrade: cvs server: failed to create lock \ndirectory for `/var/cvsroot/jakarta-jetspeed.ctma.war\u0027 (/var/cvsroot/jakarta-\njetspeed.ctma.war/#cvs.lock): Permission denied\n\nI don\u0027t know why this would happen in 3.0 and not in 2.1.x\n\nProblem 2) There seems to be several errors fecthing local contents from the \nserver. The following type of error appears frequently in the log:\n\nProblem writing resource \u0027/jakarta-jetspeed.ctma.war.jsupgrade/index.jsp\u0027. \nResource /jakarta-jetspeed.ctma.war.jsupgrade/index.jsp already exists\n\nAre you using an external tool to modify resources? If not, I also noticed the \nfollowing exception which may be related.\n\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Illegal attempt to modify an immutable tree.\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.dtree.AbstractDataTree.handleImmutableTree\n(AbstractDataTree.java:235)\n...",
    "Did you start 3.0 M5 on your existing 2.1.0 workspace? Although this should \nwork, it has not been widley testing. You may want to try starting 3.0 M5 with \na fresh workspace and see if the problems persist.",
    "Michael,\n  Come on now.  Requiring a user to start with a fresh workspace - that\u0027s not\nreasonable.  I have probably 40 projects in my workspace.  I have to be able to\nuse a new version with my existing workspace - no option here.\n\nAfter getting the lock problem a couple times, it just went away.  Almost like\nit was using the wrong userid or password to try to access the repository but\nthen figured it out.  This problem has not reoccurred.\n\nThe other problems are persistent:\n\nThe problems where it says the resource already exists, are what is keeping me\nfrom being able to update any of my projects from apache.  Of course the\nresource exists, I\u0027m just updating it!\n\nI am not using any external tools to update resources.  I may check a repository\nwith command line CVS just to make sure I can access the repository but I do not\nperform any updates or commits from command line.  And in fact I have not used\ncommand line CVS to access the repositories that I\u0027m having problems with here.\n Just eclipse.\n\nThe \"Illegal attempt to modify an immutable tree\" error is preventing me from\nbeing able to perform Override and Update on folders.  Sometimes I can get this\nto work and sometimes not.  The thing is it should work all the time!\n\n",
    "Gerry,\n  You are right that Eclipse will support 2.1.x to 3.0 migration and ideally \nwe would like to support 2.1.x to any 3.0 integration or milestone build but \nunfortunately we simply do not have the manpower to test the migration for \nevery integration and/or milestone build and still get anything done. In \nwouldn\u0027t surprise me if the M5 milestone had problems in this area as there \nhave been major changes made since M4.\n\nSo, my goal in getting you to start with a new workspace was to determine if \nit was possibly a migration issue (and make it possible for you to work). If \nyou prefer to stick with your current workspace, then we can continue to \ninvestigate the problem.\n\nIt appears that the resources causing problems are folders. The folders appear \nto exist in the file system and not Eclipse (hence why I asked about external \ntools). Can you perform a Refresh (avalable from the context menu of the \nNavigator or Packages Explorer) on the project in question (jakarta-jetspeed) \nand see if this allows you to perform the failing CVS operation. Also, could \nyou rename the existing log file and attach any new logs that are generated. \nThanks.\n\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d6953)\nE3-M5 log showing tests\n\nMichael,\n  Ok, I moved the log file aside and then I refreshed three projects -\njakarta-jetspeed, jakarta-pluto, and jakarta-slide.  After the refreshes I was\nable to update all of these from the repository.  Don\u0027t know why the refreshes\nwould make a difference since everything was working just fine under 2.1.0 but\nthey do.  I haven\u0027t run any other tests yet but I wanted to give you this\ninformation right away.  I looked at the log that was generated.  It is very\nshort.\tIt says it couldn\u0027t find a .project file and generated a new one.  It\nshould have been able to find it don\u0027t know why it would have a problem doing\nthis.  It would also seem that there should have been more in the log that just\nthis short entry.  But maybe not since there weren\u0027t any errors during the\ntest.  \n\nIt may be worth putting a notation in the release notes about doing a refresh\non each project when using existing workspaces.\n\nI\u0027m still testing and will post additional errors to the bug.\n",
    "The .project error is caused by the Override and Update. Since the .project is \nnot shared with the repository (I assume since its a jakarta project), the \noverride and update deletes it. To avoid this problem, add \".project\" to \nthe .cvsignore file. If the .cvsignore file isn\u0027t in the repository, you can \nadd the \".cvsignore\" to the .cvsignore file so that neither file is \noverwritten on an Override and Update.",
    " \"To avoid this problem, add \".project\" to the .cvsignore file,,,\"\n\n  I would think that having .project and .cvsignore in the .cvsignore file would\nbe the default!  Nearly all open-source projects are team shared to members\nusing different IDEs.  IDE control files should not be part of any project. \nEclipse shouldn\u0027t assume that either of these files will be in any repository.\n\nI\u0027m still testing...",
    "Yes, I agree. I was just pointing out that, if neither was in the repository, \nthere was something you could do to avoid having the resources deleted by an \nOverride and Update.",

    "  More on read lock error:\n  I\u0027m having users access the repository under their own cvs ids and this is\ncausing the problem perhaps.  When I opened up the repository to world writable\nthe read lock error goes away.  Trying to figure how to setup repositories this\nway through eclipse but not run into this situation again.  Suggestions?\n\n",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d7012)\nE3-M5 log showing CVS errors\n\n  Ok, the native CVS repository is working good.  I tried an number of remote\ncvs command line project creates, imports, updates, commits.  Everything\nworked.\n\n  I then went into Eclipse and created a new project and shared it with this\nsame repository.  I tried a number of things.  I first tried commit, then I\ntried to do an import of a sub project and sync this with the repository, merge\n\nany difference and then commit.  Was never able to get this to work.  I\u0027ve\nattached the log which shows all kinds of identifiable and internal errors\nwhile\nattempting to commit, import, update, etc.\n",
    "  Also, note that the imported subproject introduced a new directory \u0027xml\u0027 which\nseemed to thoroughly confuse eclipse.\n",
    "  What\u0027s even more interesting is that I just took a look at the repository and\nthe \u0027xml\u0027 directory is there!  Permissions/ownership are the same as all the\nother directories.\n",
    "  I just tried creating a project, importing a subproject that overlays a\nsection of the project, syncing with repository, merging, and then commit the\nresulting merge which should have everything.  I do the create and commit it, I\nimport the subsection and then sync with the repository, I merge any differences\nand then commit the result.  The problem is that when I replace with the HEAD,\nwhich should have everything, instead I get the first commit directory structure\nwith overlayed content.  Directories that were part of the import are missing. \nNot good.\n",
    "I\u0027ve looked through the log. There are a couple entries that can be ignored \nfor the purposes of the problems you\u0027ve been seeing. FYI, they are:\n\n- Some file have CR/LF line endings in the repository. This shouldn\u0027t cause \nany problems unless you are using the files with Linux tools which choke on \nCR/LF line endings.\n\n- For some reason, the purging of stale cache entries is failing. The Java \nFile#delete() method returns false if a delete fails and we report this in the \nlog. I don\u0027t know why this would be happening but the problem is logged but \notherwise ignored.\n\nThere are two entries which indicate a more serious problem which must be \nleading to the failures you are seeing.\n\n1) The CVSSyncInfo#makeInSync method in NPEing. I suspect this indicates that \nthe internal CVS data structures are corrupted somehow.\n\n2) The ElementTree.openElementData method is failing an assert. I suspect this \nindicates a problem in the Core internal data structures. Since the CVS \ninternal data structures make use of the Core data structures, this may be the \ncause of the CVS failure.\n\nTo know for sure, I would really like to try and reproduce this but need more \ninformation first. Could you give a description of the exact steps you took? \nPlease state your actions in terms of the menu items or other operations used \nin Eclipse. Also, it\u0027s not clear to me what you mean by \"importing a \nsubproject that overlays a section of the project\". Could you give more detail \nabout this and the file structure arrangement you are using?",
    "  Ok, this is from memory now so may not be perfect but here goes:\n\n Attempted to:\n Set up a Simple project.\n Shared the project with my local repository.\n Import project contents from a zipfile.\n Commit to CVS.\n Import a subsection of project from filesystem selecting overwrite existing.\n (like receiving an update from an outside third-party, may contain additions\n as well as modifications)\n Update to refresh with CVS.\n Add/edit some files.\n Team | Synchronize with Repository\n Compare files and merge or Mark as Merged.\n Commit to CVS.\n\n Repository should now contain everything.\n",
    "  The file structure was just your typical java war structure.  It had about\n2800 files.  I took one from production to use for testing.  I took sections of\nthis structure and modified some files and added a directory and used these for\nthe second import.\n\n\n",
    "Why did you end up with conflicts (i.e. why did you need to do a mark as \nmerged)? If I import a zip file over a project shared with CVS, I don\u0027t get \nany conflicts. Did the zipped file structure contains CVS folders (i.e. was it \nzipped from a project checked out from CVS)?",
    "  I don\u0027t know why there were a few conflicts.  I was hoping you might know. \nThere were no CVS folders in the import.  After retrying this scenario several\ntimes I was finally able to get both imports into the repository.  But this was\nnot without flaws.  There always seemed to be some type of error that forced me\nto recommit or reupdate and resync until it all worked.  An IDE should never\nproduce these types of errors using CVS and I\u0027ve never experienced these types\nof errors while using CVS with other IDE\u0027s.  I should basically be able to do\njust about anything with the files and the IDE should either determine that it\ncan perform the operation and do it or warn me (not error) about a problem and\nnot allow the operation.  When you get aborted operations and internal error\ntype messages you have no clue what state it has left the repository in.  These\nshould just never occur, for any reason.",
    "There are several factors that may contribute to the errors you are seeing. \nThe most relevant one is that you are using an IDE that is in the middle of a \ndevelopment effort. For many people it is still quite usable but for others, \nsuch as yourself, there are major problems. Being a small team, we rely on \nthis type of feedback and will make every effort to reproduce any problems and \nfix them.\n\nAnother contributing factor is that we have written our own CVS client. This \nallows us to do things that other IDEs that use the CVS CLI cannot. Again, we \nrely on community feedback to ensure that our client is robust and supports \nall the scenarios and use cases that users of Eclipse require.\n\nSo, what I\u0027m saying is that we are not taking the problems you are \nexperiencing lightly. I can\u0027t promise I\u0027ll fix it until I know what the \nproblem is. I have not yet been able to reproduce the problem but I will be \nspending time on it this week so hopefully I will determine what the problem \nis.",
    "  I think eclipse is a fine product and I take the time to test and report these\nthings because I want to help make eclipse a better IDE product.  If I might\nsuggest a few things.  I would create an entire automated test sequence for CVS\nthat tested every permutation of valid and dumb things that users could do while\nusing CVS.  Some examples, what if a user deletes his entire local project tree,\nthen creates or imports some files into the tree and then tries to update or\ncommit.  What is the IDE going to do?  Can it determine sensible actions to take\nor allow.  What if the user has a project and tries to import selecting the\n\u0027complete structure\u0027 option and then tries to update or commit?  Or what if the\nuser has a project, wants to change part of the project structure and so deletes\na part of the tree, recreating it at some other location and then tries to\ncommit or update.  Can the IDE make sense of all of this?  It must.  The IDE\nmust be able to deal with all these types of scenarios without compromising the\nstate of the repository.  The IDE should handle, without error, anything that it\nwill allow a user to do.  An automated test sequence that tested not just the\n\u0027normal\u0027 perfect behaviors but tested all the possible things that users could\ndo I think would be a good starting point toward making things bulletproof and\ninsuring the integrity of eclipse CVS capabilities.",
    "These are good suggestions for test cases. We already have a large set of \nautomated tests and are adding to them daily. I will look into adding ones \nthat cover the scenarios you mentioned. Unfortunately, many of the problems we \nare encountering are not due only to unanticipated scenarios but also to the \nfact that we support background operations that may run at the same time. \nOften scenarios, on their own, do not exhibit problems but may if another \noperation is running in the background. This is a bit more complicated to test \nusing an automated test suite. We due run our tests with a lot of the \nbackground tasks enabled but this will only catch a fraction of the potential \nfailure cases.",
    "I have a similar problem using m5.  I have been using e3 since m1 and I have \nstarted getting these couldn\u0027t create resource because resource already exists \nerrors only in m5.  I tried switching back to m4 but had the same problem so I \nam back using m5.\n\nThe other problem is that an update used to take a max of around 3 minutes.  \nNow my update is taking 22 minutes and I had 3 items that were new.  \n\nI think this has to do with decorations, I see that the decoration progress \nintermitently appears during this process.  All I know is that it is almost \nunbarably slow especially with the above errors requiring me to continually \nrepreform this update.\n\n\n",
    "So I tried a few more things:\n\nUpdate with Eclipse #1   13 minutes\nUpdate with Eclipse #2   23 minutes\nUpdate with Eclipse #3   9 minutes\n\nFull checkout using wincvs:  5 minutes\n\nUpdate with Eclipse #4   internal error will attach exception",

    "MG, Michael asked that you open your own bug for your issues.  Please stop\ncontaminating this bug with uncommented stacktraces.",
    "My two cents, then i\u0027ll shut up, this bug is already too crowded.\nMichael, i have seen messages like \"A resource already exists on disk...\" on\nwindows, the last just yesterday, when you have in CVS repository two or more\nresources, files or folders, with the same name but different case, that for\nunix filesystem and eclipse are indeed different resources, but for win32 api\u0027s\nthey are one.\nEven if ntfs filesystem support mixed case, when you access resources via win32\napi\u0027s you cannot have two resources with same name even if of different case.\nAnyhow, for what i can remember from yesterday, M5 behaved differently from\nprevious releases, while before i had error messages for conflicting resources,\nbut the checkout or update were continuing, with M5 the update stopped as soon\nas it found the conflicting resource.",
    "Gabriele, I tried checking out a project with two files of the same name with \ndiffering case and got the same behavior in 3.0 as I get in 2.1.2 (i.e. the \ncheckout stops at the conflicting file). If you think that it should continue, \nperhaps you can enter a separate enhancement request expecially since \"this \nbug is already too crowded\" (to quote a previous post;-)",
    "A summary of the problems in this bug report:\n\n1) Assertion failures from Core: probably due to known bug in M5 that has been \nfixed for M6.\n\n2) CVS sync information lost: porbably due to point 1.\n\n3) Failure to delete cache entries: Now handled more gracefully\n\n4) NPEs is makeInSync: Fixed for M6\n\nI also can across a few performance issues related to reconnecting projects \nwhich I fixed as well. I\u0027m marking this bug as fixed in M6. If you see \nproblems in M6, please enter a new bug report."
