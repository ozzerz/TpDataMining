    "Rodolfo, you cannot extract an Eclipse build on top of an existing one, this has\nnever been supported. For more info on upgrading Eclipse (and preserving\nworkspaces), see:\n\nhttp://help.eclipse.org/help21/index.jsp?topic\u003d/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/tasks-2.htm\n\nDavid, your problem is different, since you are getting rid of the existing\ninstall. Are you sure you installed the Eclipse SDK instead of Eclipse RCP SDK?\nThe Eclip SDK should contain 84 plug-ins in the eclipse/plugins dir. The RCP\ndrop contains 11.",
    "Closing as original issue was invalid. David, please reopen if you downloaded\nthe right drop (not the RCP drop).",

    "David, just so you can work: rename ~/.eclipse to ~/.eclipse.old, and try\nstarting again.",
    "Did the workaround work for you?\n\nI could not reproduce the problem on Linux (RH9). Did I miss any steps, David?\nWhat I tried:\n\n1) installed 3.0 RC2 as root under /usr/local. Eclipse install location is\n/usr/local/eclipse\n2) as a user, started /usr/local/eclipse/eclipse, choosing ~/workspace as the\nworkspace dir. A ~/.eclipse directory was created by Eclipse as my private,\nwritable configuration location\n3) exited Eclipse\n4) as root, completely deleted the existing install (rm -Rf /usr/local/eclipse),\ninstalled 3.0 final under /usr/local (same location as before)\n5) as a user, started /usr/local/eclipse/eclipse. Eclipse 3.0 started without\nany problems.",
    "The workaround does indeed work.  I even still have my run configurations and\nwindow size.  Very nice.  What important is stored in ~/.eclipse anyway?  Things\nyou change in the Preferences?\n\nAs far as your attempts to reproduce the problem, they look fine, so there\u0027s\ngotta be something specific in my ~/.eclipse it\u0027s tripping over.  Do you want a\ntarball of it or something?",
    "Most stuff that is in there is cached state that can always be rebuilt, this is\nwhy there is usually no problem in deleting it.\n\nYes, it would be good to have a look at your old configuration directory. Please\nadd it to this PR. Thanks.",
