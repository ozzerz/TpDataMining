    "Switched back to 20020411 and it does still not work. I guess my workspace is\ndead now. Any hint to recover?",
    "I found the bug after first\n- updating my workspace\n- deleting metadata files\n- setting up a new workspace\n- and when it still did not work: debugging into it.\n\nThe problem was an error in a plugin.xml file. For some reason (?) such errors\nare neither shown to the user nor logged to the .log.\n\nHere\u0027s the error that happens during startup and which is then completely hidden:\nmessage\u003d \"Error while processing\nfile:D:/EclipseWorkspace/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/plugin.xml:  assertion\nfailed: The service (3rd) component of plugin version identifier, 2.0.M5, must\nbe numeric..\"\nIf I had seen this message then I would have known immediately what\u0027s wrong: the\nplug-in ID contained a character which seems to be invalid.\n\nMoving from blocker to critical. Giving the fact that a same error has already\nbeen reported and was probably also caused by a bad xml file.\nTest Case:\n- replace the version (number) of a plugin.xml with \"2.0.M5\"\n",
    "It looks like there are 2 separate issues here. \n\n1). Why do we get an NPE? Why isn\u0027t the runtime plugin in the plugin registry.\n2). Why isn\u0027t the error message about the plugin_id being logged?\n\nDebbie, please look at the error message and see why it isn\u0027t being logged. \nWhen finished, please annotate and re-assign bug to me.\nThanks.\n",
