    "There\u0027s a subtle bug in the config.ini of the new RC2:\n\nThe line\neclipse.product\u003dorg.eclipse.sdk.ide\n\nmust be replaced with\neclipse.product\u003dorg.eclipse.platform.ide\n\nbecause the product-ID changed.\n\nElse Eclipse will refuse to start and give you this error:\n\"No application id has been found.\"",
    "Nope.  There is a new SDK product.  The id is correct.  RC2 seems to be \nstartig fine for everyone around here.",
    "Strange. I downloaded from the Austrian mirror under\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file\u003d/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.1RC2-200506101757/eclipse-SDK-3.1RC2-win32.zip\u0026url\u003dhttp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/softeng/eclipse/S-3.1RC2-200506101757/eclipse-SDK-3.1RC2-win32.zip\u0026mirror_id\u003d7\n\nand in the ZIP the config.ini is definitely wrong. Just checked again.\nIn the config.ini therein it reads:\n\neclipse.product\u003dorg.eclipse.sdk.ide\n\nStrange that only one mirrored ZIP should be wrong, but it is.\n",
    "When Jeff said the product id was correct he meant that org.eclipse.sdk.ide *is*\nthe *right* default product for RC2. The SDK drop contains such product. The\nmain difference you can notice is that instead of opening the Resource\nperspective on a new workspace and showing a Welcome view, it now opens on the\nJava perspective (which is what most people downloading the SDk want).\n\nThat being said, it should not be causing any startup problems to you. How did\nyou install Eclipse RC2? On an empty directory or on top of an existing install?",
    "Thanks for the explanation.\nHowever I\u0027m still experiencing the problem, also with RC3.\n\nI have been working with Eclipse since 1.0 (ok actively since 2.0:), so I have a\nJava workspace with some plugins set up.\n\nI always install into a new directory, so it\u0027s really a fresh installation.\nI only take my old configuration with me, but always overwrite config.ini (the\nonly file contained in the corresponding directory in the ZIP).\n\nThis is the error-message I get btw:\n\n!SESSION 2005-06-22 11:09:47.192 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dI20050617-1618\njava.version\u003d1.5.0_03\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003dde_AT\nCommand-line arguments:  -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 2005-06-22 11:09:53.99\n!MESSAGE Product org.eclipse.sdk.ide could not be found.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-06-22 11:09:53.177\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.RuntimeException: No application id has been found.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run(PlatformActivator.java:204)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:376)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:163)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.invokeFramework(Main.java:334)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:278)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:973)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:948)\n",
    "you are likely taking too much of the old configuration.  There are no \nguarantees about the format or content of the configuration area.  The files \nthere are the private domain of the related plugins and they are free to do \nwhat they like.  Please retry with a fresh config area. \n",
    "I will try, thanks.\nHowever I do not understand why the readme.html explicitly states that the\nproduct id should be changed to the new one, in the section\n\n\"No branding with old config.ini\":\n\n\"The work around is either to delete the local config.ini or update the\neclipse.product line to read eclipse.product\u003dorg.eclipse.platform.ide.\"\n\nWith this change, it works perfectly, so I\u0027m still puzzled.\n",
    "We have not been able to reproduce. Closing."
