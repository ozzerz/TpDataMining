    "Invocation of\n\n\u003ceclipse.buildScript elements\u003d\"plugin@${id}\" buildDirectory\u003d\"${basedir}/../${id}\" /\u003e\n\ngives\n\nCaused by: C:\\Development\\UMLX\\org.eclipse.gmt.umlx.source\\ant.xml:73:\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Unable to find element:\norg.eclipse.gmt.umlx.\nat\norg.eclipse.pde.internal.build.tasks.BuildScriptGeneratorTask.execute(BuildScriptGeneratorTask.java:73)\nat org.apache.tools.ant.UnknownElement.execute(UnknownElement.java:275)\nat org.apache.tools.ant.Task.perform(Task.java:364)\nat org.apache.tools.ant.Target.execute(Target.java:341)\nat org.apache.tools.ant.Target.performTasks(Target.java:369)\nat org.apache.tools.ant.Project.executeSortedTargets(Project.java:1216)\n\nComparing BuildScriptGeneratorTask with BuildPluginAction suggests that the 3\nlines that initialise the PDEState are missing. Creating my own version with the\nadditional \n\ngenerator.setPDEState(TargetPlatform.getState());\ngenerator.setNextId(TargetPlatform.getPDEState().getNextId());\ngenerator.setStateExtraData(TargetPlatform.getBundleClasspaths(TargetPlatform.getPDEState()));\n\nfixes the problem.\n\n(See org.eclipse.gmt.umlx.releng and org.eclipse.gmt.umlx.releng.lib for the\nfixed classes, which are invoked as described at the top of\norg.eclipse.gmt.umlx.source/ant.xml).",
    "I looked at your changes and they are really interesting. I must admit that I\nnever thought of such a thing. However from they really deviate from the initial\nphilosophy of eclipse to be integrated as is. Indeed pde build does not really\nat all on the PDE UI nor on the workspace.\n",
    "I just recall that the \"save as ant script\" option available at the bottom of\nthe export wizard does something very close to what you want.\n",
    "\nYes, \"Save As Ant Script\" does exactly what I want manually. But when I am \nbuilding my Sources plug-in I need the build.xml files to exist. It is \nextremely tedious to manually visit every single contributing plug-in to ensure \nthat the transient build.xml exists.\n\nMy suggested change, which fixes a clear bug, enables me to have an ant script \nthat ensures that the ant files that it needs exist automatically.\n\nIf there is a problem with dependencies, then this should be resolved by fixing \nthe erroneous dependency, rather than by declaring this an inappropriate fix. \nIt is certainly the intent of my use to run without the IDE. I have a script \nthat needs to work with the current workspace plug-ins. This is not the UI, so \nthe UI dependency should not inhibit it. Else recognise that \neclipse.buildScript is UI-dependent and move it to PDE UI.",
    "My original fix does not work in Eclipse 3.3M5 since the internal packages are no longer exported.\n\nWhat is the problem in incorporating what is clearly a bug fix.\n\nThe documentation on eclipse.buildScript clearly states that it works for all elements, not just installed elements.\n\nI now need this fix."
