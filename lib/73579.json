    "I got the following error after doing these steps: \n\n1) create a new java class in the default package called dddd.java, open it\n1b) open a second file in an editor\n1c) switch back to dddd.java (i.e. make it the active editor)\n2) change the encoding for that file to \"UTF-16 (little-endian)\" from the Edit \u003e\nEncoding menu\n3) click on the other file in the package explorer to cause the editor to activate\n4) click back on dddd.java in the explorer and ... the follow exception is\nprinted to the console\n\njava.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException\n        at java.lang.String.charAt(String.java:385)\n        at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.infoviews.SourceView.computeInput(Unknown\nSource)\n        at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.infoviews.AbstractInfoView$2.run(Unknown\nSource)",

    "This is not critical for 3.0.1: the Source view simply shows the source it\nshowed before (title shows the element that corresponds to that source) and the\nSource view is still functional afterwards.",
