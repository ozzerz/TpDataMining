    "P4 means that we won\u0027t do it unless someone else asks for it, but there is a\nclear use case right now (back up) so I\u0027m setting it to P3.  ",
    "What is the address of the developer page that describes what the priorities \nmean? I can\u0027t seem to find it anywhere.",

    "FYI: Here\u0027s the descriptions from dev.html [and how I\u0027m currently interpreting \nthem]\nP3: considered for next week \nP4: later [will do it, but not next week]\nP5: requires user input to be prioritized [won\u0027t do it unless someone asks]\n\n",

    "These patches add the export to zip feature and a simple test. The patches \nalso include changes for Bug #111870, so please apply these instead.",
    "I just applied this patch and it\u0027s looking good.  I think that zip file checkbox\nshould state the name of the file that it\u0027s exporting too.  Also, when I first\ntried to do it it thought that the file was a directory (from the last wizard\nrun I guess) and failed, which makes it seem like the code for idenifying the\npath to save to should check if the path is a directory, and the append the\nfilename.  Jus try to do an export to dir, then to file, then to dir, and if\nthat all works we should be fine.",
    "I got a whole bunch of the following exception when I tried to export my workspace, and\nsome entries weren\u0027t exported.

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d29371)\nPatch for tasklist\n\nI believe the exception was happening because tasks appeared multiple times in\nthe tasklist file (in different categories) and could not be added to the zip\nfile twice. I\u0027ve added a check so that duplicate context files listed in the\ntasklist are ignored. When I export it looks like everything appears in the\ntarget zip. Can you check that everything exports properly now in your\nworkspace?\n\nAs for the file as directory location issue, the folder selection dialog should\nonly be able to return folders, so I don\u0027t know what is going on here and\nwasn\u0027t able to replicate this problem although I tried alternating between\nexporting to zip and exporting files. Just in case, I\u0027ve added a check that the\ndestination is a folder anyway.",
    "That must have been the problem, and this patch resolves it.  It could use a\nprogress job, but that\u0027s a very minor thing so I\u0027m closing.",
    "I guess setting Wizard.needsProgressMonitor(true) was wishful thinking :) I\u0027ll \nsee if I can figure out why that isn\u0027t working.",
    "He he, no I guess that doesn\u0027t quite do it.  You just need the file copy to run\nas a UI blocking job (like that pointer I gave you to the ReportManager).  This\nis a really minor thing and shouldn\u0027t go into 0.4.1, but it\u0027s good to know how\nto make stuff background (which you already know) and UI jobs.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d29373)\nPatch for core\n\nRevised ZipUtil method that accepts a progress monitor.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d29374)\nPatch for tasklist\n\nUpdated export wizard that shows job progress.",
    "New patch applied, progress monitor working as expected."
