    "When deleting one Job in the Job View, got the following error dialog. Also the other job that was part of the view were deleted. In addition I can not close the error dialog by pushing OK.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d72145)\nThe error dialog that appared\n\n",
    "Pawel, could you please have a look at this or at least reassign it to somebody in your team?",
    "I tried but could not reproduce the bug.",
    "I too could not reproduce the bug (on Windows). I cannot connect to the internet from Mac OS X here so I cannot check if this is visible only on this OS.",
    "I got the error when I deleted a job that was in the state WAITING (Broklerhelper error, no available resources). But I have not been able to get a job into that state again. Currently, I cannot submitt jobs, but as soon as I get a job into that state I will try again. The error may be an artifact of SWT on Mac.",
    "I also cannot reproduce the bug. Nevertheless I realized two other things:\n\n1) It is possible to delete the JSDL of a submitted job, does that make any sense? Should we really allow that?\n\n2) After I deleted a job I get error logs in regular time intervals from the model. Here is the stacktrace:\neu.geclipse.core.model.GridModelException: Failed to create grid element\n\tat eu.geclipse.core.jobs.GridJob.writeJobStatus(GridJob.java:429)\n\tat eu.geclipse.core.jobs.GridJob.updateJobStatus(GridJob.java:228)\n\tat eu.geclipse.core.JobStatusUpdater.run(JobStatusUpdater.java:81)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)\neu.geclipse.core.model.GridModelException[2]: org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Resource \u0027/mygrid/Jobs/.jsdl_test.job\u0027 does not exist.\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkExists(Resource.java:310)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.checkAccessible(Resource.java:193)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.File.create(File.java:109)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.File.create(File.java:176)\n\tat eu.geclipse.core.jobs.GridJob.writeJobStatus(GridJob.java:426)\n\tat eu.geclipse.core.jobs.GridJob.updateJobStatus(GridJob.java:228)\n\tat eu.geclipse.core.JobStatusUpdater.run(JobStatusUpdater.java:81)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)\n\t\nPawel, is your JobStatusUpdater notified about the deletion of jobs? Does it hold internally a list of all registered jobs that is maybe not updated when a job is deleted?",
    "Changing OS from Mac OS to Mac OS X as per bug 185991",
    "Jobs can be successfully deleted.\nJob updater are removed whe job is deleted.\nI still keep this bug open because comment #6.1. Job description still can be deleted from job althoug it requires direct confirmation of the user.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d81432)\nJob files are read only\n\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d81433)\nException is thrown when deleting the file\n\n",
    "See the two attachments above\n\nOn Mac OS X the job files are stored as read-only. When trying to delete them\nyou get the warning about this, but an exception is thrown and files are not\ndeleted. Maybe on the Mac platform there are something with the file permission\nthat doesn\u0027t allow you to delete them.   "
