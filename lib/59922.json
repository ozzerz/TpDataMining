Click Apply and OK.\n2- Create Simple Project.\n3- File-\u003eNew-\u003eOther-\u003eTest-\u003eRecording-\u003eHTTP Proxy Recorder, then click Next.\n4- enter \"test.rec\" as Recording file name, and click Finish. \n\nError: \n Http Proxy Recorder could connect to RAServer correctly, however, stopped at a \nstage of \"Setting up Java environment on localhost\". At that time, \njava.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError was logged in .log file. This problem does not \noccur on windows build. \n\nExpected Result: \n No error message is logged and HTTP Proxy Recoreder starts correctly.",

    "This seems lika a RAC issue on AIX.  The error is an unsatisfied link error \nlooking for native code, sendMessageBinary0().  This native method was added \nrecently, and perhaps doesn\u0027t appear properly on AIX.\n\nChanged component and owner.",
    "Bob,\n\ni believe you added this code.  The issue with AIX is you must explicitly name \neach and every exported function in a shared object in a export file.  Please \nmake sure this entry is added to the export file.  If you are tight for time \nplease delegate this Samson.  Its a 2 minute fix.",
    "Richard, \n\nThat\u0027s not part of what I was doing. I checked with Dave and it\u0027s part of what \nhe did a few weeks ago.  He\u0027s agreed to take it.",
    "Committed fix to Head.",
    "Fix was to add the new native sendMessageBinary0 method name to the AIX \nlibhcjbnd.so export file hcjbnd.exp. ",
