    "On Windows Mobile 2003 Second Edition both the horizontal and vertical \nscrolling is very poor when the a virtual or normal table is loaded with a large \nnumber of items: 6+ columns and 150+ rows.  Tree scrolling is better than table scrolling but still not usable.",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d49239)\nPR_152321b.java - Win32 API version of the code\n\n",
    "I\u0027ve had a chance to look into this and have improved scrolling on the desktop.  Please get the latest code from HEAD and try it again for the table.  NOTE:  I have not touched the tree scrolling code so don\u0027t bother restesting it.\n\nI have included PR_153231b.java that creates the same table as your example code.  It contains a flag VIRTUAL that you can use to toggle virtual/non-virtual behavior.  The code uses only Win32 API which means that this is about as fast as you can possibly get.  If scrolling in this example is not acceptable, then it\u0027s time to write a C code example.\n\nNOTE:  There are many more optimizations that I can do but I won\u0027t be able to look at this again until next week.  Please retest the old code and run PR_153231b.  If the non-VIRTUAL case is \"fast\" for you, I can make the non-VIRTUAL case in SWT \"fast\" too.\n\nPart of the problem with saying something is \"slow\" is that \"slow\" is subjective.  I was horrified when I ran your example on WM2003, then I ran the Win32 API version and it wasn\u0027t much better (for me).  If everything is still too slow, then I will construct a benchmark that measures times and we can compare some concrete numbers.\n\nThank you for entering this bug report and following up with us.  Talk to you next week.",
    "Hi Steve\n\nI got the HEAD revision of the SWT code base and built the swt.jar for the Win CE ARM version of the library. I then built and re-ran my examples using this library (and its corresponding DLL from the HEAD revision) on the Pocket PC and unfortunately the scrolling is still unusable.\n\nI also tried to running your example but it failed with the exception:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: PR152321b$1.windowProc(IIII)I\nat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Callback.bind(Native Method)\nat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Callback.\u003cinit\u003e(Unknown Source)\nat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Callback.\u003cinit\u003e(Unknown Source)\nat org.eclipse.swt.internal.Callback.\u003cinit\u003e(Unknown Source)\nat PR_152321b.main(Unknown Source)\n\nAm I missing something?\n\nI will be on holiday until 18th September so if you need any more information from me or want me to try anything else it will have to be today.\n\nThanks\n\nMik\n(Nstance Limited)",
