    "I\u0027ve imported an Eclipse 3.0 project into 3.1M7. The user libraries were \nimported but show as (unbound). \nSelect an \u0027unbound\u0027 User Library and try to \"Configure...\" In the \"Edit \nLibrary\" dialog box click on the \u003cUser Libraries\u003e button to get to the \npreferences page. Now click on \u003cImport...\u003e This generates an \"Unhandled event \nloop exception\" \"Assertion failed; Path for IClasspathEntry must be absolute\" \nerror. No other dialog box appears.",
    "Could you please attach your project for investigation?\nThanks.",
    "Please also attach .log file or exception stack trace if any, thx",
    "I have a similar bug in Eclipse SDK Version: 3.1.0, Build id: I20050610-1757.\nWhen I select User Library -\u003e Import, nothing happens in the UI. When I check\nthe error log, I have a stack trace for every time I hit the Import button. The\nstack trace starts with the following:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 0 2005-08-16 10:52:17.74\n!MESSAGE Assertion failed; Path for IClasspathEntry must be absolute\n!STACK 0\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.Assert$AssertionFailedException: Assertion failed;\nPath for IClasspathEntry must be absolute\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.Assert.isTrue(Assert.java:89)\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d26144)\nStack Trace from Help -\u003e About -\u003e View Error Log\n\nProvided stack trace - the only plugins I have installed are CheckStyle 4.0.0\nand XMLBuddy 2.0.62.",
    "Further (baffling) information: I should point out that my workspace was stored\nunderneath my Eclipse home directory (c:\\java\\eclipse-3.1\\workspace\\), with my\nworkspace projects referenced from locations outside the workspace (e.g.\nc:\\projects\\myproject). \n\nWhen I switch my workspace to an external location (e.g. c:\\projects), the User\nLibrary -\u003e Import function appears to work as expected.",
    "Steps to replicate:\n\n1. Import legal user library using Windows -\u003e Preferences -\u003e Java -\u003e Build Path\n-\u003e User Libraries -\u003e Import.\n2. Modify .userlibraries file externally to use classpath variables e.g. ${CORE}\nas opposed to an absolute path in URI form.\n3. Hit import again. \n\nWhat should happen:\n\nImport dialog box should appear, at least saying that the file is invalid.\n\nWhat actually happens:\n\nNothing in the UI. Stack trace added to error log.\n\nThis bug is a duplicate of bug 93061 and should be marked accordingly.",
    "This seems to be a problem with Mac OS X installation of 3.1 also. The behavior is identical. In my case, \nthe location of the workspace is outside the eclipse installation directory (/Users/tayub/workspace).  ",
