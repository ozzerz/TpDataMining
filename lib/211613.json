    "The API documentation for Pack200 used by the JarProcessor states the following:\n\n\"In order to maintain backward compatibility, if the input JAR-files are solely comprised of 1.5 (or lesser) classfiles, a 1.5 compatible pack file is produced. Otherwise a 1.6 compatible pack200 file is produced.\"\n\nAll fine and well. The problem occurs when the JAR-file contains zero classfiles. When that happens, the pack200 doesn\u0027t see any reason to maintain backward compatibility and hence, will produce a packed file that, when unpacked from a Java 1.5 environment, will produce the following error:\n\nStack Trace:\njava.io.IOException: Corrupted pack file: magic/ver \u003d CAFED00D/160.1\nshould be CAFED00D/150.7\n\n at com.sun.java.util.jar.pack.NativeUnpack.start(Native Method)\n at com.sun.java.util.jar.pack.NativeUnpack.run(Unknown Source)\n\nA good example is the file org.eclipse.swt_3.3.2.v3347.jar\n\nI think it would be great if the JarProcessor would recognize this fact and refrain from packaging jar files that contains no class files.",
    "As a work around, I think org.eclipse.swt could be \"marked\" as \"do not pack\"? \n(in the eclipse.inf, if I recall?). \n\n",
    "There are many bundles that contain no class files. You\u0027d think pack200 would only generate in the new format if a Java 6 class is present... "
