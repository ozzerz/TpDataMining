    "My System:\nWin2K with Sun JDK 1.4.2_01.\n\nWhen I want to install a plugin with the update manager I run into\ntrouble.\nI create a new site bookmark and can select the plugin. But after\naccepting the licence I cannot choose an \"Install Location\". The list is empty.\nIf I click the finish button I get a NPE. When I choose a folder with\nthe add button I get the message \"Target location already exists\".\nI\u0027ve tried the following URL: http://p4eclipse.sourceforge.net/site?\n\nI get the same problems when I try to install from the \"My Computer\" Node\nin the \"Feature Update\" Pane. I followed the install instructions from the \nStellation instruction page:\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/indextech.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.stellation/d\nownloads/features/libsInstall.html\n\nI\u0027ve also tried the following Versions from eclipse with the same results:\n3.0M3, 3.0M4\n\nWith best regards,\n\nMarcel Odendahl.",
    "I am running a brand new 3.0 M4 driver and don\u0027t see any problems.\nCan you run this driver and append the .log file to the bug ?",

    "What p4eclipse version are you trying to install?\nI tried version 0.0.8 and I could install to the existing eclipse install \nlocation, but I could also add another site. Both scenarios worked fine.\n\nThe only difference is that I did not have to set any proxy, but that should \nnot affect target site location.\n\nI can see why the log file shows an error in the install operation, but that \nis certainly caused by not being able to pick a site in the first place.\n\nAre you running completely \"clean\" ? No previous install, no previous \nworkspace? I assume you also have enough read/write access with that windows \naccount.\nTry looking at Help\u003eSoftwareUpdates\u003eManage Configuration and see what sites \nare listed, just to ensure you see the right stuff. You may want to add \nanother site in that view, and use it later when installing p4eclipse.\n",
    "I tried to install the version 0.6.2.\nBut with the version 0.0.8 I got the same problems.\n\nI\u0027ve unzipped the archive on the top of the drive c:.\nI also unzipped it in a completely different directory. I think eclipse\nlives only in its install directory. Am I right?\nI searched the registry and didn\u0027t found an entry for eclipse.\n\nI have administrator rights on my install machine.\n\nWhen I look at \"Manage Configuration\" I see the location with the directory\nwhere I installed eclipse. But when I want to \"Link an Extension Location\"\nI always get the message \"Selected location does not contain extensions.\nPlease select another location.\" The message is shown even when I try to link\nto another eclipse installation in another directory.\n\nAm I to stupid to use eclipse or what is the matter? :-((",
    "Don\u0027t worry about not being able to add the site via the Configuration \nManager, I gave you wrong \"directions\".\nI realized that when you add a site, the site must have a specific directory \nstructure, and a marker file as well. In most cases, it is for existing sites, \nnot for creating new.\n\nAs for your actual problem, I still don\u0027t understand what\u0027s going on.\nTry the following (installing from the command line):\n\nExit eclipse, then run the following command from inside the eclipse directory:\n\njava -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main -applicationo \nrg.eclipse.update.core.standaloneUpdate -command install -from \nhttp://p4eclipse.sourceforge.net/site -featureId \nnet.sourceforge.perforce.win32 -version 0.6.2\n\n\n",
    "Append \"-nosplash -consolelog -debug\" to the above command as well.",
    "Ok, I\u0027ve tried your command line. But I\u0027m sitting behind a firewall.\nI\u0027ve tried the -DproxyHost, etc. flags with no success.\n\nHow can I tell your command to use the proxy and not connect directly?\n\nWith best regards\n\nMarcel Odendahl.",
    "It appears that the parameters used are:\n\n-Dorg.eclipse.update.core.proxy.host\n-Dorg.eclipse.update.core.proxy.port\n-Dorg.eclipse.update.core.proxy.enable \n\n",
    "Correction: those properties (org.eclipse.update.core.port/host/enable) are \nnot system properties, but plugin properties.\nYou can set in a file called preferences.ini inside the \norg.eclipse.update.core plugin.",
    "I released some code fixes for proxies that would allow you passing the \nstandard java http.proxyHost and http.proxyPort as parameters on the command \nline and have the update manager use them.",
    "I am closing this bug. Please re-open if you still see any issues."
