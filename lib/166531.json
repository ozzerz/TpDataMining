I\u0027ve encountered the issue as well with the patch2 that was attached to the original contribution.  The plugin works fine in hosted mode, but when you export the plugins and run directly the ClassNotFoundException for the HTMLEditor results.\n\nWhat is the repository path?\n\nAlso, are there any more details on this issue as it is currently marked \"resolved fixed\"?\n\nThanks,\nJohn",

The reporter or one of his colleagues must now wait for the next integration build in order to test the fix, at which time the bug will be marked \"VERIFIED\" or reopened.",
