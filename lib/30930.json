    "Below is the actual bug that i believe exists inside the Java plugin window \n2000 version.  I created a hello world project and then a class to see how \nthings are compiled inside the plugin.  (based on the steps described on the \nfaq:http://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/faq/eclipse-faq.html#users_5) the faq number \nis 6.  once i try to run the program, it throughs an exception and says that \n\"Exception occured during Launch\"\n\"Reason : Exception occured executing command line\"\n\nAfter that i look at the .log file to trace the problem and found that the \nstring or the path to the source file has some how been corrupted as can be \nseen by the error given below. the path comtains quotes \" \", in the middle of \nthe path which i believe is causing the problem.  And  i didnt find a way to \nremove those quotes through the preference diaglog. So i basically could not \ncompile my code with the compiler.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.debug.core 4 120 Feb 04, 2003 18:21:45.680\n!MESSAGE Exception occurred executing command line.\n!STACK 0\njava.io.IOException: CreateProcess: \nC:\\Program\" \"Files\\eclipse\\workspace\\HelloWorld\\HelloWorld.java \nC:/Program\" \"Files/eclipse/workspace/HelloWorld/HelloWorld.java error\u003d123\n\tat java.lang.Win32Process.create(Native Method)\n\tat java.lang.Win32Process.\u003cinit\u003e(Win32Process.java:72)\n\tat java.lang.Runtime.execInternal(Native Method)\n\tat java.lang.Runtime.exec(Runtime.java:551)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.core.DebugPlugin.exec(DebugPlugin.java:489)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.ui.externaltools.internal.program.launchConfigurations.ProgramLaunch\nDelegate.launch(ProgramLaunchDelegate.java:93)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch\n(LaunchConfiguration.java:147)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.LaunchConfigurationsDialog$6.\nrun(LaunchConfigurationsDialog.java:1241)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run\n(ModalContext.java:95)",
    "Your description says you are creating a simple HelloWorld program and running \nit, but the stack trace contains a reference to the \u0027external tools\u0027 launch \ndelegate, which implies something else is going on.  Can you reproduce this \nproblem?  If so, can you post a list of detailed steps to reproduce?  Also, what \nversion of Eclipse, and what VM are you using?  Thanks.\n",
    "It looks like you\u0027re trying to launch a Java application using the external\ntools support for launching programs. You should launch Java applications\nusing a \"Java Application\" launch configuration (available from the Run or\nDebug menus in the Java perspective).\n\nIf you configure it correctly, you should still be able to use a \"Program\"\nconfiguration to launch java, though. Can you provide the details of the\nlaunch config you\u0027re using? What are the values of the fields on the \"Main\"\ntab?",
    "From an email from infoapex1@netscape.com:\n\n\n\n\nHi\n\n\nAll i was trying to do was compile the basic hello world program according to \nthe FAQ on your web site(eclipse.org).  i think it was FAQ # 6.\n\n\nI know what the problem is and was able to compile the code.\n\n\nThe problem is with the fact that the tool which takes care of gathering paths \nto the jdk and the source code does not recognize blank spaces in path   like \nhow the Windows operating system allows you to create or insert a blank space \ninside your path eg.\n\n\n\"c:\\Program Files\"\n\n\n\n\nthe tool does not recognize the blank space between the Program and Files as \nshown above which basically screwed up everything for me.\n\n\nI had installed the jdk inside the above mentioned directory and also the \neclipse IDE.\n\n\nThe work-around for this problem was to install both the jdk and eclipse in the \nroot directory.  \"c:\\\".\n\n\nthis basically cleared the problem.\n\n\nlet me know if you need further clarification on this matter.  I feel this still \na bug cuz most people on windows would be by default, would be installing the \nsoftware in the program files directory.\n\n\nThanks\n\n\n",
    "The real question here is how, if you were following the steps in the tutorial, \nyou wound up with \u0027external tools\u0027 in the walkback.  If you can duplicate this \nproblem, a detailed step-by-step set of instructions on how to reproduce the \nproblem would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\n",
    "I have not been able to reproduce this problem - both using external tools and \njava application launch configurations, using the \"JRE\" from \"C:\\Program \nFiles\\Java\\...\"."
