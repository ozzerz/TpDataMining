    "Build ID: I20070625-1500\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nThe get a starting ACServer I had to gave all scripts and executables in the agent controller bin directory the executable rights. Then the ACServer starts but doesn\u0027t stop with ACServer -shutdown. The result is an endless wait of eclipse. I can only kill eclipse to solve this. Than I changed the ACStop.sh and RAStop.sh scripts to kill the relevant processes. So now I can stop and start the ACServer from within eclipse. The test connection function gives me a positiv result. But when I try to profile a application I get the following error:\n\nThe process launcher seems to be inactive.  Restart the Agent Controller and try again.\n\nThe retstart doesn\u0027t help. Thank you for your help.\n\nMore information:",

    "Hi Martin,\nWhat kind of Agent Controller are you using - integrated or standalone?\nCould you please try any last build of standalone AC 4.5 or 4.4.1?\n",
    "I tried standalone and integrated. On both I get the same result. But I need the integrated. I will try this version: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file\u003d/tptp/4.5.0/dev/TPTP-4.5.0-200710190400/tptp.runtime.allInOne.linux.gtk.x86-TPTP-4.5.0-200710190400.zip \nIs this the version you mean. Thank you for your help.",
    "I tried the version from my last post and the problem is the same. I get the message that no agent controller is running.",
    "I tried like successed the remote agent controller. I get following results:\n./ACStart.sh: 52: [[: not found\n\nThis can be fixed by setting /bin/sh to /bin/bash because on my system (ubuntu) the link sh points to dash.\n\nACServer: error while loading shared libraries: libtptpUtils.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nThis is can be fixed by renaming the libs from *.4.4.0 to *.4",
    "Next problem is:\n\n./ACServer: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\n\nFixed this by setting an symlink to libssl.so",
    "Now it starts. But ps shows:\n20508 pts/0    S      0:00 ACServer\n20510 pts/0    Z      0:00 [tptpProcessCont] \u003cdefunct\u003e\n\nA zombie process from tptp. Now I will try to connect.",
    "Trie to connect with sample client that shows:\nERROR: Unable to connect to the Agent Controller running on localhost at port number 10006",
    "Does no one of the developers use this linux version? Who compiles this version? How can I compile this version?",
    "Bing, would you please see if you can assist Martin with this please?",
    "With a self compiled version the Sampleclient works. But if I connect from eclipse I got the following error in the rac log.\n\nptrace() call failed for pid 14379\nPC monitorProcessState: Failed to monitor process 14379\nAgent Manager received an unexpected error response TPTP_Error ",
    "Martin,\nLet\u0027s investigate the problem with original AC 4.5 build.\nPlease provide servicelog.log file with DEBUG level.\nThanks.",
    "I sent a log file before. And now after such a long talk you say enable DEBUG and you think I know how to enable it? Please, be more helpful.\n\nI say it again first problem is that it is linked against libraries that aren\u0027t in the package, the second problem is that the executebles aren\u0027t marked as one, the third is that it is linked against a libssl.so.2 that version doesn\u0027t exist in my distribution (only version 0.9.8) and the fourth is that the shell scripts use bash specific things but insert /bin/sh on my system this is a link to /bin/dash. So if no one is fixing this I cannot help. And that\u0027s why I compiled it myself. But this was a big pain. It needs a lot of changes in the source because files like asm/system.h doesn\u0027t exist on my system and I have the kernel source installed. Some functions that are called seemed to be outdated on my linux kernel (2.6.22) e.g. syscall1.\n\nI have to use tptp for my bachelor theses. Please help me to get it running.",
    "Martin, \nLet\u0027s try any last 4.5 build of Agent Controller from http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/home/downloads/?ver\u003d4.5.0\n\nI see that the main problem is defuncting of the tptpProcessController process.\nPlease download and install standalone Agent Controller.\nCurrently AC doesn\u0027t depend on openssl package and you don\u0027t need libssl library now.\n\nTo enable DEBUG please modify file $TPTP_AC_HOME\\config\\serviceconfig.xml - substitute level attribute in the \u003cLogging..\u003e tag by \"DEBUG\" value.\n\nBTW: To build AC you can use AC.SDK which contains some required low level libraries, so you can don\u0027t deal with kernel headers.\n",
    "Hi Martin,\nDo you have any update on this?",
    "I have done a quick test. No defunct process on startup (great). But I get the following message on startup of ACServer:\n\nStarting Agent Controller.\nException in thread \"Thread-0\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/hyades/internal/execution/file/FileServer\nACServer started successfully.\n\nThe sample client works.\n\nBut I do not tried to profile from eclipse. I will test this on the weekend. Is this version also available as the integrated profiler?\n\nThank you for your help.",
    "This is strange message.\nFileServer class should be contained in $TPTP_AC_HOME/plugins/org.eclipse.hyades.execution_build_number/hexl.jar archive.\n\nJVMTI profiling doesn\u0027t need this class and should work without it. ",
    "TPTP_AC_HOME is set to %RASERVER_HOME% and RASERVER_HOME is set to the home of rac. So the jar isn\u0027t explicitly add to the classpath.",
    "I tried remote profiling from eclipse and it works now like excpected. Great. I downloaded the complete tptp package from 2007-11-13 and tried the internal but had for now nosuccess. I will try with the iac next week again. Thanks for the your help.",
