    "I have not merged the 3.3 fixes to the file transfer service back up to 4.0.  \nWhen I do, this will be fixed.",
    "Todd -- these file transfer fixes have been merged from 3.3 to 4.0, so this \nshould all work again.  Can you please validate with the 4.0 i3 milestone \ndriver?\n\nThanks!",
    "Reopening because \u0027Test\u0027 still doesn\u0027t run on z/OS, but fails differently (June \n16th build).  Now the launch just kind of hangs.  Adding 99368 as a dependency \nper Scott S.",
    "\nTodd, please re-test on the next official build (late Sunday or Monday \nmorning, 6/20/2005) and let me know if this doesn\u0027t fix the hang.  I do not \nknow what is causing the hang -- but I just finished the merge that this \ndefect is potentially at same level dependent on, thanks!\n-Scott",
    "\nJust another bit of information that is known but not recorded yet, if the\nbackend is switched out to the 3.3 RAC then things work as expected.",
    "\nThe ProcessExecutorImpl class calls into the startProcess0 native method and it\nfails with a return code of -1.  The test runner Java VM process is never\nlaunched and then the test hangs until an InactiveProcessException occurs.  I am\nnot sure why the process failure is occuring in the native code yet, the only\nthing I see changed in hclaunch.c since 3.3 (into 4.0) is the\nconvertJavaStringToNative(...) method being used and added to RAComm.c.\n\nSo far it appears like this might be a regression in the native code since TPTP\n3.3 on z/OS but I cannot confirm this yet.",
    "\nOkay, the fix is in the native side, libhclaunch.so associated code.  I have\ntested with a new libhclaunch.so binary that Samson built and test execution now\nruns to completion with test execution results that (just using a quick sanity\ncheck) appear correct.\n\nRe-assigning to Samson per his request so he can code review these changes with\nHendra and/or others on his team.",
    "This is caused by the following:\n- incorrectly converted twice the execution command line parameters\n- incorrectly converted the \"\u003d\" and the \":\" on the z/OS (from the makefile)\n",
    "Fix checked into TPTP 4.0 CVS 2005/06/30 3:40pm EDT.\n",
    "ACTION: Please verify/close this defect.",
    "Closing by default since not closed by the originator in the 7+ months since being resolved.  \n\nPlease reopen if the issue is still present in the latest TPTP release or the resolution is not correct."
