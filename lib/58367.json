    "Method getFeatureIncluded() in class org.eclipse.update.core.model.FeatureModel \nthrows the following exception.\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Object \nat org.eclipse.update.core.model.FeatureModel.getFeatureIncluded \n(FeatureModel.java:414)\n\nI tracked the problem down.   The method getFeatureIncluded() is trying to cast \nan array of IncludedFeatureReferenceModel to IIncludedFeatureReference.\n\nNow the method comment shows that the method should return an array of \nIncludedFeatureReferenceModel not IIncludedFeatureReference.",
    "In general, the update.core and update.core.model have leaked implementation \ndetails, they are not cleanly done, and you point to a perfect example of this.\n\nThe question is: how did you get a class cast exception? Have you instantiated \nyour own features?\n",
    "I got the exception while call the method.    I created the feature model using \nthe following snippet.\n\nurl \u003d new URL(pathToFeatureXML);\t\t\t\nfmf \u003d new FeatureModelFactory();\nfeature \u003d fmf.parseFeature(url.openStream());\t\t\n\n",
    "The model classes should be private, not API\u0027s, but the authors have probably \nnot anticipated this usage when the package was designed.\n\nFeature creation happens via factory methods, you\u0027re not supposed to be \ninstantiating model classes directly. \nFor example, features downloaded from an update site are created using \nFeaturePackagedFactory.createFeature() and those already installed using \nFeatureExecutableFactory.createFeature() (don\u0027t ask me why the name sound \nFrench :-)\n",
    "Can you confirm if the workaround I sent you works or not? Thanks!\n",
    "The work around worked fine.  Thanks again.",
    "Thanks. I have lowered the severity to normal, if that\u0027s ok with you.\nI will add a disclaimer to the model classes, to cover our past mistakes, and \nhopefully fix them in a follow up release.",
