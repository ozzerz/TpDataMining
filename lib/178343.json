    "Build ID: I20070320-0010\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nI ran UI tests 3 times. One time a have got failure named: The editor open trace was incorrect for testOpenTestFile. Other two runs, ended wtih no errors. The test might be non deterministic.\n\nMore information:\n\njunit.framework.AssertionFailedError: The editor open trace was incorrect\n\tat junit.framework.Assert.fail(Assert.java:47)\n\tat junit.framework.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:20)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.tests.multieditor.MultiEditorTest.testOpenTestFile(MultiEditorTest.java:172)",

    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Are you running with any other plug-ins?\n\u003e \n\nI run it on clear Eclipse.",
    "I\u0027ve run these tests on my linux box (at home and work) plus they passed in the I build.\n\nThey can be sensitive to a locked screen or if anything else is going on in the system (i.e. you can\u0027t be doing anything else while these tests are running).\n\nDo either of those scenarios seem likely?\n\nPW\n",
    "Oh, 2 more questions:\n\n1) which version of GTK+?  Mine is:\nbash-3.00$ rpm -q gtk2\ngtk2-2.4.13-22\n\n2) Do they fail if you run just the multi editor tests?  If they do, go to your junit-workspace right after and attach the .log file to the bug, please.\n\nThanx,\nPW\n",
    "I run this test by VNC and i don\u0027t lock screen and nothing else is going on the system. During tests i was one user of this system.\n\nMy gtk version is: gtk2-2.4.13-19\n\nWhen i run just the multi editor tests they don\u0027t fail.",
