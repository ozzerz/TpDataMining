    "NE asks:\nAre you able to reproduce this using the vanilla 3.1 build, without CC added? \nE.g. show the Properties view, then select a resource in the Navigator?\n\nJohn replies:\nthe answer to this question is \"Yes\"!  I get the NPE at\nTreeItem.computeDisplayText, line 280.",
    "I can reproduce the problem without our plug in installed.\n\nFirst, as a check:\n1) start up eclipse m5a/motif on Linux of Solaris (either one)\n2) using a simple project with one package and a single java file, I nav all the\nway down and open up the java file in the editor.\n3) open the Property View (Window -\u003e Show View -\u003e Other -\u003e Basic -\u003e Properties)\n4) nothing bad happens.\n5) close the tree so that only the project is showing and be sure to close down\nthe editor.\n6) shut down eclipse.\n\nThen (this will show the NPE):\n1) start up eclipse again, pointing at the same simple project but do not nav\ndown or open an editor.\n2) open the Property View\n3) select the project (which should be closed since it was closed above or if\nyou start with a newly imported project).\n4) I get the NPE in\norg.eclipse.swt.widgets.TreeItem.computeDisplayText(TreeItem.java:280)\n",
    "One more thing... in my first set of steps in \"Additional Comment #2\", once\n\"nothing bad happens\", you can select anything in the tree without getting a NPE.",
    "John, I can\u0027t reproduce the problem here, though I\u0027ve tried your steps and\nseveral variations.  Some questions about the steps:\n\nIn the first set of steps:\nStep 2: I cannot create a Simple Project that contains a Package, only a Java\nProject can contain a Package.  Is your project a Java Project, or did you mean\nsomething different by \"package\"?\nStep 5: By \"close the tree\" I assume you mean collapse it, not Close the\nProject?\n\nIn the second set of steps:\nStep 2: When I restart eclipse, the Properties view is already open since it was\nleft open from the first set of steps.  Should it have been closed previously?\n\nAlso, does the perspective that you\u0027re working in seem to matter?\n",
    "Hi Grant...\n\nI apologize for the imprecision in my steps...\n\n\u003eStep 2: I cannot create a Simple Project that contains a Package, only a Java\n\u003eProject can contain a Package.  Is your project a Java Project, or did you mean\n\u003esomething different by \"package\"?\n\nYes, I meant to say a Java Project that contains a package...\n\n\n\u003eStep 5: By \"close the tree\" I assume you mean collapse it, not Close the\n\u003eProject?\n\nYes, collapse the tree.\n\n\u003eIn the second set of steps:\n\u003eStep 2: When I restart eclipse, the Properties view is already open since it was\n\u003eleft open from the first set of steps.  Should it have been closed previously?\n\nMy experience was that it did not matter... but my last go around at this, I\nclosed it in the first set of steps.  I found if I did not close it, then I\nwould get the NPE\u0027s the instant I selected something.",
    "Grant,\n\nRegarding your comment about having the properties view open... my most recent\ntest indicates that it ought to be closed and that the NPE occurs when the prop\nview is first opened.  I just ran a test where the prop sheet was opened alread\nand all was ok.  Then I closed it, and when I reopened it, I got the npe.  I\nalso had to recreate my workspace because the one I was using yesterday seemed\nto be corrupt... which perhaps led me to my conclusions about whether the\npropsheet should be open or closed.",
