    "It would be helpful if the resource tree returned better error messages.  I got the following \nduring a test of mine, and I don\u0027t have a clue what could be \nwrong.\n\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Problems \nencountered while deleting resources.\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Resource.delete(Resource.java:460)\n\t... \u003csnip\u003e \n...\n\nIf it said the following, it would be a huge improvement in \nusability.\n\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: Problems \nencountered while deleting resources, could not delete C:\\foo\\blah",
    "The exception should contain a MultiStatus, and the status children should give\nyou a better indication of what happened.  Do you get a MultiStatus?",
    "I got the stack trace from a JUnit test failure, so I would have to hack JUnit to look at the \nMultiStatus.  And, I can\u0027t debug this problem, because debugging it changes the timings of things \nand the problem goes away (hacking JUnit might also change the timing of things).\n\nIs there any \nway to make the (plain-old-vanilla) stack dump more informative?",
    "Is there any way you can log the exception?  The platform logger knows how to\n\"unwind\" nested exceptions and statii and dump all the information to the log file.\n\nWhat API method are you using?  If you\u0027re using IResource.delete we could\nimprove the MultiStatus message.  If you\u0027re using IWorkspace.delete then that\u0027s\nthe best we can do.",
    "I\u0027m using IProject.delete(boolean, boolean, IProgressMonitor).",
    "Marking invalid.  All the necessary information is included in the status, which\ncan be logged to obtain all the details."
