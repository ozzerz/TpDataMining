    "Would you have a test case to reproduce this problem?\nWhat are your compiler settings?\nMight be a duplicate of bug 159973.",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Would you have a test case to reproduce this problem?\n\nIt seems to be quite similar to bug 159973.  My hunch when I saw it was it related to interfaces that extended multiple interfaces and implementations that implemented multiple interfaces that had multiple common base interfaces.\n\n\u003e What are your compiler settings?\n\nCompliance 1.5 - default compliance settings.\n\n\u003e Might be a duplicate of bug 159973.\n\nThat seems likely - I reran 159973 in 3.2.1 and it gives similar sorts of errors.  The wierd thing is the error message has *really* odd characters in it.\n\nNOTE: This is a regression from 3.2 (it compiled and ran fine then).\n\n\n",
    "Could you please provide a test case to reproduce?\nEven if it looks like a dup of bug 159973, bug 159973 doesn\u0027t have those weird characters.\nAs soon as we have your test case, we can investigate.\nSetting severity as critical since it seems to be a regression.",
    "setting as a dup of bug 159973.\nPlease try the next integration build and let us know if it fixes your problem.\nWe could also issue a update build for 3.2.2 in the update list of the jdt/core web page.\nLet us know what you prefer.\nThanks.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 159973 ***",

If it\u0027s relatively simple to deploy that\u0027s fine - I can test with it.  It might take me more than a few hours to produce a test case - no point if it is likely fixed.",
    "Yes, next integration build is tomorrow.\nLet us know if you reproduce your issue with this build.\nThanks.",
    "(In reply to comment #6)\n\u003e Yes, next integration build is tomorrow.\n\u003e Let us know if you reproduce your issue with this build.\n\u003e Thanks.\n\nWorks fine with 3.3M3 - thx.",
