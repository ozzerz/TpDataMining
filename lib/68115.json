    "Problem:\n\nWhenever I start the RAC on our linux 390 box I get the following exception:\n\njava.net.BindException: Address already in use\n        at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketBind(Native Method)\n        at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.bind(PlainSocketImpl.java:355)\n        at java.net.ServerSocket.bind(ServerSocket.java:340)\n        at java.net.ServerSocket.\u003cinit\u003e(ServerSocket.java:207)\n        at java.net.ServerSocket.\u003cinit\u003e(ServerSocket.java:119)\n        at\norg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.file.FileServer.run(FileServer.java)",
    "Note that despite this exception, the RAC seems to work fine.  I can remotely\nprofile the applications without any problem",
    "This exception is being thrown because, there is probably another instance of \nthe RAC file server or some other process listening on the file server port of \nthe RAC (10005). The port number to which the file server binds can be \nconfigured by editing the serviceconfig.xml file. This problem can be fixed by \nchanging the file server port to another port which is currently not in use.",
    "In any case, this should provide the user with a more meaningful message and\nrecord the exception in the log file rather than dump it to the command prompt.",
    "This exception needs to be caught and logged as Navid suggests. I have \ntargetted it for 3.1 I2.",
    "I talked to Bob about this defect, and retargetted this defect to 3.2",
    "This is in response to Navid\u0027s first comment. I implemented a fix for this \nproblem, and while I was testing my fix by profiling with 2 instances of RAC \nrunning simultaneously (on different control ports), I found that if we try to \nconnect to the RAC which was started last, we cannot profile the application. \nThough a java process is launched by the RAC, we cannot profile the \napplication. (even without my fix)\n\nSo Navid has been able to profile successfully even after the FileServer did \nnot start, but the control server started a second time, probably because his \nprofiling application was connected to the RAC that started first.\n\nIs this a known issue? i.e the user not being able to use the second RAC to \nprofile his applications.",
    "This is a known issue.  The results are unpredictable when two instances of the \nRAC are running on the same machine.  That is not a supported scenario.",
    "The fix for this defect has been checked into the Hyades HEAD (3.2) stream. So \nI am closing this defect.\n\nResolution description:\nI now catch IOExceptions and BindExceptions that could occur in the file \nserver and set error codes. After the file server is started from the Agent \nController, I check for the error status, and if there has been a \nBindException or IOException, I log the error messages, instead of dumping the \nstack trace on the console.",
    "Verified in TPTP-4.0.0-200507120100 driver.",
    "Closing"
