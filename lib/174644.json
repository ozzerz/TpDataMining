WAS 6 was up but could not see profile tooling menu\n\n... is there any short-term/workaround relief ?",

It just so      \nhappens that I get this error also when just selecting \"Profile\" from    \nthe menu shortcut. Bottom line is we as a development team are unable to \nprofile.           \n\n... please expedite ...                                                      \n",

    "Steps to debug the problem:\n\nMethod A:\n1. Replace RAD6_INSTALL_FOLDER\\eclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui_3.3.0\\core_ui.jar with the one attached in the bug.\n2. Change directory to RAD6_INSTALL_FOLDER\\eclipse and run run.bat attached here from that directory.\n3. Check RAD6_INSTALL_FOLDER\\eclipse\\stdout and RAD6_INSTALL_FOLDER\\eclipse\\stderr files for any exception and attach them to the bug.\n \nMethod B:\n1.\tImport org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui plugin with sources using Import -\u003e External Plug-ins and Fragments wizard.\n2.\tReplace /org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui/src-core_ui/org/eclipse/hyades/trace/ui/internal/launcher/ProfilingSetsManager.java java file with the one from the bug\n3.\tPut a breakpoint at the beginning of \"void org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.internal.launcher.ProfilingSetsManager.readFilters(String  profilingSetsStr)\" method\n4.\tStart a Debug session of RAD in self-hosting mode and check where the NullPointerException happens and report it on the bug.\n\n",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d59732)\nRAD6_INSTALL_FOLDER\\eclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui_3.3.0\\core_ui.jar \n\nModified core_ui.jar, includes the new version of \"void org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.internal.launcher.ProfilingSetsManager.readFilters(String \n profilingSetsStr)\"",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d59733)\nrun.bat\n\nCopy this file into RAD6_INSTALL_FOLDER\\eclipse and run it after the core_ui.jar is updated as described in Method A.",
    "Dzung, please let me know when you get more details regarding this problem.",
    "Customer and I used method A and got empty stdout/stderr ... should the command in run.bat included -consolelog parameter ?\n\nWe are not clear how to use method B... please give more details...",
    "(In reply to comment #12)\n\u003e Customer and I used method A and got empty stdout/stderr ... should the command\n\u003e in run.bat included -consolelog parameter ?\n\u003e \n\u003e We are not clear how to use method B... please give more details...\n\u003e \n\nYou will get empty stdout/stderr if the error doesn\u0027t happen, did the error happened during that session, if not please retry until it happens then look at those files?\n\nIn Method B you just need to import the specified plug-in with sources and add a try catch like I did in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id\u003d59731\u0026action\u003dview (or just override with that version) then put a break point on line \"e.printStackTrace();\" in readFilters method then debug that plug-in in self host mode (use Debug -\u003e Eclipse Application).\n\n\n",
    "I will close this defect as the problem was fixed, the simple workaround is to delete the following file:\n\nTHE_WORKSPACE_ROOT_FOLDER\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.core.runtime\\.settings\\org.eclipse.hyades.trace.ui.prefs\n\nand then restarting the workbench.\n\nPlease open a Hyades 3.3 defect for the migration problem.\n",
