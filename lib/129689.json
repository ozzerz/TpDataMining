    "After creating an example eclipse RCP application everything runs great.\n\nIf I add another, new, dependency, I have been using org.eclipse.ui.forms or org.hibernate.eclipse as examples (since this is when I first noticed the bugs I kept using them for testing) the application does noet start anymore.\n\nthis is my log entry:\n!SESSION 2006-02-27 23:17:49.937 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dunknown\njava.version\u003d1.5.0_06\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003dnl_BE\nFramework arguments:  -application test.application -pdelaunch\nCommand-line arguments:  -application test.application -data C:\\java\\runtime-EclipseApplication -dev file:C:/java/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/Eclipse Application/dev.properties -pdelaunch -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2006-02-27 23:17:50.468\n!MESSAGE Bundle initial@reference:file:../java/workspace/test/ [11] was not resolved.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.osgi 2006-02-27 23:17:50.468\n!MESSAGE Missing required bundle org.eclipse.ui.forms_0.0.0.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2006-02-27 23:17:50.468\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Application \"test.application\" could not be found in the registry.

    "Could you give detailed steps on how to reproduce?",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Could you give detailed steps on how to reproduce?\n\u003e \n\nYes, sure, and I can also give you a fix, well, fix more like a work-around...\n\n1) create an RCP application, any one, I tried hello RCP or the RCP mail application\n2) first thing after creating, RUN IT!!\n3) close rcp application\n4) add a new dependency, should work with any, I usually took org.eclipse.ui.forms\n5) try to run it again using the link\n6) get the exception in the log\n\nNow, the work-around wich I am currently using: using \"run...\" to remove the entire launch configuration of the eclipse application and create a new one, and it launches again.\n\nI have build automatically enabled ... not that it is directly related, but I would expect that if you add a dependency and run using your excisting configuration it would just launch and not give too much problems.\n\nSince they are working hard to improve RCP in 3.2, I saw some handy improvements already in the short time I was testing it, but I think that this could save other people time and removing run configuration and re-adding it doesnt seem like a logical thing you should do when developing an rcp application and changing dependencies.",
    "This is a PDE-UI issue.  When the RCP launcher is first created it includes the set of bundles which the rcp application currently requires.  When you add a new requirement the launcher is not updated to include that new required bundle.\n\nTo workaround the issue you should:\n- Open the launcher for the RCP application.\n- Goto the Plug-ins tab\n- Click on \"Add Required Plug-ins\"\n- Save and run the launcher again.",
    "*** Bug 164395 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Is there any update on this one? Things get more complicated when e.g. adding a new editor (e.g. the template Multi-Page Editor). These extensions spawn a number of required dependencies that are nto automatically added as required plugins.",
    "Is this still an issue with 3.3?",
    "For 3.3, you will have to use the workaround in comment 3.",
    "I will summarize Wassim\u0027s proposed fix.\n\nMany people take great time crafting their launch configurations.  For these users, we don\u0027t want to start messing with their configuration if they have customized it.\n\nSo, if the user initiates the action by clicking the launch shortcut on the Manifest Editor and the launch configuration has not been previously edited, then we can assume the user would like PDE\u0027s help in launching the plug-in and its dependencies.  For this case we can run the \"Add Required Plug-ins\" functionality and add any new dependencies to the launch configuration.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d76242)\npatch\n\nImplements algorithm in comment #8.  By clicking the launch shortcut from the Manifest Editor, dependencies will be calculated for each launch as long as the user has not previously customized the configuration.",
    "Applied patch.  Will be available in 3.4M2.",
    "*** Bug 201054 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Thanks Brian.\n\nThis fix, in combination with bug 172716, would constitute a single N\u0026N entry about an easier auto-managed way to launch an RCP app.\n"
