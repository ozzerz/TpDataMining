    "Driver:  WTP 2.0 M5 + attachment 59445 in bug 168765\n\nGo through bottom-up scenario with client with Axis2 runtime, click Next to the Axis2 Client Creation Preference page (need to rename this), the page is empty except for ADB Databinding, clicking Next resulted in:\n\nException occured while code generation the wsdl\n    java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.utils.WSDL2JavaGenerator.getAxisService(WSDL2JavaGenerator.java:335)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.command.Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.execute(Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.java:83)\n    at org.eclipse.wst.command.internal.env.core.fragment.CommandFragmentEngine.runCommand(CommandFragmentEngine.java:414)",
    "Same problem still exist with the 2007_03_14_code_attachment (attachment 60820) in bug 168765. ",
    "New stack trace based on attachment 60820 is:\n\nException occured while code generation the wsdl\n    java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.utils.WSDL2JavaGenerator.getAxisService(WSDL2JavaGenerator.java:366)\n    at org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis2.consumption.core.command.Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.execute(Axis2ClientCodegenCommand.java:85)",
    "With top-down plus client scenario, the Axis2 client preference page is filled in (not blanked).  However, the WSDL file used is the original WSDL file that\u0027s used in the beginning of the skeleton scenairo, not the live WSDL file that represents the Web service that\u0027s newly generated.  For example, if the original WSDL file has the endpoint as:\n\n\u003csoap:address location\u003d\"http://localhost:8080/a1/services/Echo\" /\u003e\n\nWe then create an Axis2 skeleton in Web project \"a2\" using that WSDL file.  I expect the resulting EchoStub to contain:\n\nthis(\"http://localhost:8080/a2/services/Echo\" );\n\nHowever, it contains,\n\nthis(\"http://localhost:8080/a1/services/Echo\" );",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d61128)\nfix for the bug\n\nwill fix the bug.\nBut the created client was added to another web project with Client suffix \nIs this a feature or we need to get this out and generate to same project?",
    "The idea of the current framework is the Web service is generated into the current selected project, say \"ProjectX\", and the client is, by default, generated into another project, \"ProjectXClient\".  This is so to prevent the situation where the generated client files overwriting the service files if the client project is the same as the service project.  I\u0027ll give this patch a try a little bit later on.  Thanks!",
    "With attachment 62215, the original problem with creating Axis2 bottom-up Web service with client is gone.  However, I still run into the problem described in comment #3, namely, the original WSDL used to create the skeleton is passed to the client side rather than the newly generated WSDL representing the correct endpoint of the skeleton Web service.",
    "Also, the correct WSDL uri representing the newly deployed Axis2 Web service is not passed to the WSE.",
    "Setting target to RC0 since these scenarios are main path scenarios:\n\n1. Invoke WSE with correct URL for WSDL when setting service slider to TEST.\n\n2. Skeleton scenario with client.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d66314)\nfix for the bug 175030\n\nFix for the generated service WSDL representing Web service not passed to Axis2 client and the WSE\n\nThis patch also include a Refactoring of BUServiceContext to ServiceContext. \n\nVerified and tested. Please review and commit. This was timed as RC0\n\nThanks \n\nLahiru \n",
