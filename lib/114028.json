    "\nFix in hand, doing some more testing before delivery.  Had to do with the same\nissue that was found with tests on Linux last week.",
    "\nThe fix I have is to remove the quotes completely from the %JAVA_PATH% insertion\nin test.tools.core pluginconfig.xml (changed a few months back via one of\nSamson\u0027s defects bugzilla_106568).  I\u0027m not sure if this will break anything\nelse, I will re-assign to platform but first make the fix to i3 so z/OS test\nexecution will work. \n\nI will fix in the workaround and then test this fix on Windows and Linux to\nensure no other regressions.  It might be that this has to be fixed in\n\u0027launcher.c\u0027 by Samson/Hendra before we ship i3.  Samson knows more about what\nwas involved with the original change in bugzilla_106568.",
    "Reassigning to Scott. If needing to fix in native code, please assign to \nSamson.",
    "\nI tested the workaround of removing the \u0026quot;\u0027s from %JAVA_PATH% use in the\ntest.tools.core pluginconfig.xml file in the RAC.  Test execution still works on\nWindows XP, Linux and z/OS with the fix.\n\nI believe the interesting experiment will be to run it where the JAVA_PATH\ncontains spaces and is not surrounded in quotes any more.",
    "\nSamson, I believe the severity of this can be reduced to major from blocker\nsince we have a workaround.  We are also release noting the fact that if any\ntype of hang like this occurs the user can modify the pluginconfig and attempt\nquoting the paths, etc.",
    "I suggest this should be fixed in 4.1.  This affects windows os as well as \nothers, and many JVMs install into a directory with spaces in the path by \ndefault.  (For example \"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\j2re1.4.2_08\")  This problem is \ndifficult to diagnose when it occurs, and should be trivial to fix.",
    "One question, is this a regression from a previous RAC release on z/OS? I want\nto isolate whether this is due to a recent change in the launcher code.\n\nIf the config change is the preferred way, I would suggest we change the z/OS\nconfig only while keeping the quotes on other platforms.",
    "If it turns out that we are going to fix the z/OS config file for this release,\nwhat I suggest is to lower the severity and defer to 4.2 instead of closing this\nbug as fixed since we just workaround the root problem.",
    "\nSamson, I delivered the patch you sent me, this defect can now be resolved.  ",
    "As per Scott\u0027s comment, the fix is committed.",
    "Reopening the bug as Samson\u0027s earlier comment seem to indicate the severity \nshould be lowered becuase a workaround was provided, not actual fix. Samson \ncan dispose of it properly.",
    "Sri. I think we can close it for now unless there is a request to support\nspace-separated directory names on the z/OS, which is very rare and may not even\nbe supported. The fix has been verified on the z/OS."
