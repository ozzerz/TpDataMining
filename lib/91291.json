    "This is caused by trying to log an error after the platform has shutdown. John?",
    "That\u0027s correct.",
    "I won\u0027t log anything in this case. The plan is to log situations where jobs are\nstill running when runtime shuts down. People shouldn\u0027t be leaving jobs or\nthreads running after their own plugins have shutdown.",
    "Is it possible to know what jobs are running?",
    "I\u0027m going to add more debugging when there are jobs still running at shutdown. \nRight now there is no way to tell from the stack trace what job was running.  If\nit\u0027s easy to reproduce, you could see what job is running by catching the\nAssertionFailedException.",
    "See also bug 91391.",
    "*** Bug 91391 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "I have released fixes for this exception and for the exception in bug 91391. \nErrors will be printed to System.err when the platform has already shut down. \nThe real bug is that a job is still running at that point.  I have added\ninstrumentation to report warnings in the log file for any job that is still\nrunning when the platform has shut down.  If you re-run your tests with latest\nruntime+resources from head, you should see the culprit that was causing these\nexceptions."
