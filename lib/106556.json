    "It doesn\u0027t crash horribly, it throws an exception so the application can decide\nwhat to do if cairo is not available.  This is the same as on Windows if GDI+ is\nnot available (Windows 2000 and earlier).\n\nSWT 3.1 depends on cairo 0.4.0 which is a development snapshot.  A pre-built\nbinary of cairo 0.4.0 is included with Eclipse in the root directory beside the\neclipse executable, and also in the SWT standalone download for 3.1. \nApplications requiring the advanced graphics API under Linux should put the\nappropriate path including this library on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH."
