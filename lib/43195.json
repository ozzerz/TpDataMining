    "I am using the latest nightly build:\nVersion: 3.0.0\nBuild id: 200309160010\nAnd when I tried setting debug points, they appeared on the left hand ruler to\nbe displaced by 1 line all the time. (The light bulb also appeared to be\ndisplaced by 1 line all the time.) I have attached a screen shot to illustrate this.\n\nWhen I tried to debug, I got lots of errors - I have attached the .log file.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d6125)\nLog file\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d6126)\nPartial Screen snapshot\n",
    "Luc, please investigate the NPEs in the log coming from the java debug model.",
    "From the log:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.model.JDIValue.getValueString(JDIValue.\njava:129)\n\nThis NPE is crazy. If you read the code here, it looks like:\nif (fValue \u003d\u003d null) {\n  return \"some string\";\n}\nreturn fValue.toString(); // NPE here\n\nSince the valud of fValue is only set in the constructor, I don\u0027t understand how \nthis execution flow is possible.",
    "The NPE I picked above is reported better in Bug 42970. Moving discussion of \nthis NPE there.",
    "Vijay: do you still have the problem in the latest integration build ?\nI suspect that some bad code had been release by the jdt-ui team in the 0916\nnightly build.\nI never saw the problem.",
    "This problem seems to have been resolved with the latest integration build (from\nlast week). A linked problem was that the breakpoint used to appear on the next\nline (with respect to the current cursor line).\nClosing this as fixed.",
    "Closing."
