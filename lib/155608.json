    "As a first time user for BPEL I went straight to the new -\u003e BPEL file and went on making the BPEL file. However the wizard did not do anything when I pressed finish (it flashed and came back)\nI realized the problem as my workspace being empty (this is a fresh eclipse installation and the workspace is empty). It worked when I created an empty project and started the wizard by right clicking the project. \nHowever what I feel is that the wizard should produce an error message if it cannot proceed.\nI\u0027ve pasted the root cause of the stack trace from the error log\n\nRoot exception:\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.bpel.ui.wizards.BPELCreateOperation.save(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.bpel.ui.wizards.BPELCreateOperation.run(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext.runInCurrentThread(ModalContext.java:369)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext.run(ModalContext.java:313)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d49023)\nError log that contains the full stack trace\n\nI\u0027ve pressed the finish button a few times hence the same error is repeated",
    "Pretty sure this has been fixed."
