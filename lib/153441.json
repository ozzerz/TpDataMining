    "We include JDT in our product offering. When I started my product exceptions were thrown from org.junit_3.8.1. See below.

    "What do you mean by \"We include JDT in our product offering.\"?",
    "The products are IBM being installed on fresh machines that never had any other products installed. The error mentioned originally occurs on the first start up of the product. ",
    "I guess that the product which is built on top of Eclipse is probably wrongly adding/containing JUnit which it must not do. There\u0027s nothing Eclipse can do to prevent this. Please check the product whether it contains org.junit as part of it.\n",
    "Can you please explain your last comment? We add all features and plug-ins that are delivered. They are all added to the platform.xml so that they can be loaded. Our platform.xml specifies every plug-in and feature that should be loaded. If the plug-in is not specified in the platform.xml file then it will be ignored and will not be loaded in the product and will not be accessible in any way. ",
    "\u003eWe add all features and plug-ins that\n\u003eare delivered. They are all added to the platform.xml\nThe platform.xml should only contain features, see:\nhttp://help.eclipse.org/help32/index.jsp?topic\u003d/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/update_platform_xml.html\n\nJust to clarify: you get the exception when starting the product (e.g. by clicking on an exe file) the first time, right? I\u0027m asking because otherwise bug 124867 might apply.",
    "Yes this is at product start up. I don\u0027t think it is related to 124867\n\nAs to the url there is section with the following excerpt:\n\npolicy - defines the way the \"list\" attribute is interpreted: \nUSER-EXCLUDE: all the plugins from the site are run, except those listed in the \"list\" attribute. This is what\u0027s currently used by the update code. \nUSER-INCLUDE: only the plugins listed by the \"list\" attribute are run. This is what PDE generated configurations use. \nMANAGED-ONLY: only plugins from the features define by this site (see the \u003cfeature\u003e element) are run (new in 3.1) \n\nWe specify USER-INCLUDE\n",
    "Sorry I should have parsed the whole file.\n\n\u003eYes this is at product start up.\nCan you confirm that this happens the very first time you launch the product? Or does it happen when you start a second or more time?\n",
    "It definitely happens the first time you start the product. I don\u0027t remember about subsequent starts of the product. I have uninstalled the product that was throwing the exception so I can\u0027t confirm if it happens on subsequent starts of the product.",
    "How did you install the product? Was there an installer or did you unzip from an archive? If you used an installer, do you know what this installer does, e.g. does it first launch Eclipse and then installs via update manager?",
    "It uses an installer. It does not start Eclipse. It generates the platform.xml itself. I don\u0027t know the details of the internals. If you want to look at an install please contact me directly and I may be able to give you access to an installable build that you may be able to use to debug the issue.",
    "According to the Equinox team it is not possible to get this on the first startup, but maybe the installer creates some bad files (e.g. platform.xml) that causes this. There\u0027s nothing JDT can do here.\n\nMoving to Equinox for comment.",
    "I am sorry but I can guarantee it happened on the first start up. There are no if\u0027s and\u0027s or but\u0027s about it. The log file I found it in actually was created and found not in the .log directory but in the org.eclipse.update directory because I hadn\u0027t even specified the workspace to be used yet. Once the workspace was specified and I clicked the OK button on the workspace selector dialogue the log file was moved to the .metadata for the workspace specified.",
    "This defect can be closed. It is not reproducible in the latest builds. Thanks to the people that tried to follow up on this defect. ",
    "closing as per comment 13"
