    "Build ID: TPTP-4.3.0-200611160100C\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. Launch the  Symptom Editor RCP application.\n2. Import a WAS v4 or v5 local or remote sdb into symptom 2.0 format. The import fails, an error message is displayed in the local import case, in the reomte import case the wizard is not closing and no error message is displayed. \nAny subsequent operations (create new sdb, import sdb in any format, open sdb) will fail as well. The RCP application must be restarted.\n\nWorkaround: in order to be able to workaround this problem every time the RCP application is launched the first operation done should not be import WAS v4 or v5 into symptom 2.0 format.\nThe scenario that is failing in the Symptom Editor RCP works in the TPTP 4.3 Eclipse LTA and Log Analyzer RCP.\n\n\nMore information:",
    "The reason of the failure is the fact that the ECorePackageImpl is not initialized at the time the symptom loader code is trying to make the call\ndocumentRoot.getXSISchemaLocation(). \nThe following exception occurrs :\njava.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError\n\tat java.lang.J9VMInternals.initialize(J9VMInternals.java:195)\n\tat org.eclipse.emf.ecore.EcorePackage$Literals.\u003cclinit\u003e(EcorePackage.java:3466)\n\tat java.lang.J9VMInternals.initializeImpl(Native Method)\n\tat java.lang.J9VMInternals.initialize(J9VMInternals.java:177)\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.platform.models.symptom.impl.DocumentRootImpl.getXSISchemaLocation(DocumentRootImpl.java:146)\n\nTo fix the problem the EcorePackageImpl initialization needs to be forced. A patch is attached to the defect.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d54650)\nPatch for  defect 166083\n\nPatch attached.",
    "Note that this is a regression introduced in 161722.",
    "Deferring this to 4.4 as it is too risky to fix in 4.3 at this point. The proposed fix affects the import symptom catalog operation in the eclipse-based symptom catalog editor and the Log Analyzer RCP application as well, which currently work for this scenario.  The decision to defer was approved by TPTP PMC.\n\nBecause there is a workaround of using the eclipse-based symptom catalog editor, I am reducing the severity to major.\n\nPlease open a defect to add this problem to the 4.3 release notes.",
    "Increasing the priority as it needs to be fixed early in 4.4.",
    "Fixed.",
    "Verified with TPTP-4.4.0-200706140100.",
    "Closing..."
