    "My current theory is that automatic updates for the repository attributes may kill the auth token if update takes too long. So, we could try to disable that automatic update for JIRA (completely, or have a checkbox in repository preferences that to disable that).\n\nOther possibility could be to put some safeguard code around attributes retrieval or even run that in a separate job, to make it less destructive.",
    "I\u0027ve tried to debug it and come with the following findings:\n\n-- Current JiraRepositoryConnector.ensureServerConnectionValid(..) method don\u0027t really do anything. The reason it works when user hit \"Validate\" in repository settings is because server instance is wiped out and created from scratch (effectively loosing any cached attributes).\n-- I\u0027ve tried to explicitly logout using  JiraServer.logout(), but it seems like there is a bug in jira core services, so even if logout method is called, locally cached login token is not reset.\n\nAll in all it seems like we can\u0027t do anything until this is fixed in jira core services.\n\nAnother weird thing in jira core services, that it swallow any errors during fetching query results and even it catches the auth exception login token also is not reset up there.",

It stopped\n\u003e happening in my workspace once I added the add/remove server code to the\n\u003e connection reset.\n\nIt works ok when you online, but I noticed that it still fail when system goes offline (or in sleep/hybernate). The major problem is that JIRA core services don\u0027t report any errors back and just return empty result on query request.\n\nAlso, that logging to stdout is polluting my console window and I may loose some stack traces now...\n\nUnknown Issue attribute: parent\nUnknown Issue attribute: attachments\nUnknown Issue attribute: subtasks",
