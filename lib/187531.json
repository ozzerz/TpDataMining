    "Javier can you look at this?\n\nThe SystemMessage should be shown in a dialog rather than getting logged. I\u0027d recommend setting a debugger break point at the place the exception is thrown, and debugging it all way through to the point where the exception is logged rather than shown in a dialog.\n\nSystemMessageDialog.showError() and similar static methods can be used for this easily: they even switch to the dispatch thread automatically. What\u0027s important is that the call to the SystemMessageDialog is done in the UI part of RSE (i.e. in the original action that caused the operation in the Subsystem, and not inside SubSystem itself).\n\nWe want to make the SubSystem code non-UI at some point, and we want it to be well usable programmatically. Therefore, all SubSystem calls just throw exceptions, and messages are to be displayed from the UI client.",
    " (In reply to comment #1)\nAn exception is thrown by the FTP service when the username or the password are not correct and this exception is already forwarded by the subsystem to the UI layer and processed by org.eclipse.rse.ui.operations.SystemFetchOperation.showOperationErrorMessage(Shell, Throwable, SubSystem).\nThis class shows the exception in a message box and logs it in the error log, so it should be expected behaviour. \n\nI\u0027ll improve the reported error, as at the moment, when is cathed by the UI is just shown to the user as \"error\".\nWrapping the exception thrown in a RemoteFileSecurityException solves it showing the message:\n\nOperation failed. Security violation\nMessage reported from file system: 530 User xxxx cannot log in.\n\nAnd logging the exception, as expected, \"RSEF1001E: SUB#0:530 User xxx cannot log in.\"",
    "Improved exception thrown as suggested in the previous comment",
    "Should any message be logged because of an incorrect login?  It\u0027s the user\u0027s incorrect input that resulted in the error.  bug 142184",
    "Reopening as the message:\n\n\"!ENTRY org.eclipse.rse.ui 4 0 2007-06-27 14:56:13.455\n!MESSAGE RSEF1001E: SUB#0:530 Login authentication failed\"\n\nIs still logged when you enter the wrong login information.",
    "I think we need to keep the following two apart:\n\n - This bug is about improving the message reported to the user in case of\n   an invalid login. If the message shown in the dialog is useful e.g. as \n   indicated in comment #2 we can consider this bug fixed.\n\n - Bug #142184 is about not logging stuff that\u0027s shown to the user in a dialog\n   anyways. This is currently still open and a general problem with the message\n   dialogs - It\u0027s not the FTP subsystem\u0027s fault.\n\nFor me, it looks like you reopened because of bug #142184 only but this one should remain closed. Please close the bug again if you agree.",
    "Closing as the dialog has been improved to show a better error message when the user could not connect.",
    "Verified with 2.0."
