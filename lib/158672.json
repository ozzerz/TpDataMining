    "This looks like a reincarnation of bug #135155, bug #132282, or bug #135318. Found during 4.3 smoke testing on 64-bit Linux systems. Was using Sun 1.5.0_08 JVM on EM64T and JRockit on IPF; succeeded with IBM *AND* JRockit on IA32.\n\nError output is:\nConnecting to AC..\norg.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.exceptions.AgentControllerUnavailableException: Error: Unable to connect to the Agent Controller.Timeout while waiting for connection to complete\n        at org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.client.core.internal.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:132)\n        at org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.samples.TPTPProcess.main(TPTPProcess.java:78)\nError occurred while connecting to 127.0.0.1:org.eclipse.tptp.platform.execution.exceptions.AgentControllerUnavailableException: Error: Unable to connect to the Agent Controller.Timeout while waiting for connection to complete",
    "Okay, let\u0027s modify that \"succeeded\" comment. Now that I ran it (once) on Windows-IA32 and actually saw console interation, I realize that I saw *none* on Linux-IA32. Just re-tried and verified. Below is all I saw on Linux:\n\nConnecting to AC..\n\n\nConnected to 127.0.0.1 at port number 10002\n\n\n\n\nValidate Process - True\n\n\nProcess launched.\nProcess ID ::\u003d\u003e\u003e25881\n\n\nProcess exited.\n\n",
    "Still true for TPTP-4.3.0-200610090100\n",
    "Correction to previous comment - this IS working on Windows, failure only on Linux.",
    "This is a regression but is retargetted to 4.4 given that there are no consumers for this yet. I do not have the cycles to resolve this in 4.3",
    "Cannot be contained in 4.4",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d80443)\npatch\n\n",
    "Please commit the patch and test",
    "(In reply to comment #7)\n\u003e Please commit the patch and test\n\nThe patch is tested.\nI can\u0027t check it into CVS since I haven\u0027t write access yet.\nShould I ask someone to do this?",
