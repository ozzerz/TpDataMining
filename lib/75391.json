When I use Ctrl+1 and\nchoose to add a calculated serialUID, nothing happens.\n\nThe logfile shows the reported NoClassDef. It worked fine for serialUID\ngeneration for classes extending for example java.lang.Exception. I assume the\nreferenced servlet-api is not included in the classpath for the serialUID\ncalculation. \n\neclipse version is 3.1.0, i can paste the complete stack later.",
