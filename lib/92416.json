    "I received this again randomly in the latest VE build I20050707.  I was working\non a fresh workspace and fresh install between two different files in two\ndifferent projects.  Here are the steps, but i\u0027m pretty sure they don\u0027t have any\neffect on it.\n\n1) Create project SmokeTest02\n2) Create project SmokeTest03\n3) Create new JFrame in SmokeTest02 and build SayHello application. Close.\n4) Create new Shell in SmokeTest03.\n5) The first drop I tried triggered this exception below:\n\njava.io.FileNotFoundException:\nD:\\workspaces\\eclipse3.1\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.core.resources\\.projects\\SmokeTest03\\org.eclipse.jem.beaninfo\\.cache\\.index\n(The system cannot find the path specified)\nat java.io.FileOutputStream.open(Native Method)\nat java.io.FileOutputStream.\u003cinit\u003e(FileOutputStream.java:179)\nat java.io.FileOutputStream.\u003cinit\u003e(FileOutputStream.java:131)\nat\norg.eclipse.jem.internal.beaninfo.core.BeanInfoCacheController$SaveParticipant.writeIndex(BeanInfoCacheController.java:1320)\nat\norg.eclipse.jem.internal.beaninfo.core.BeanInfoCacheController$SaveParticipant.saving(BeanInfoCacheController.java:1305)\nat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.SaveManager.executeLifecycle(SaveManager.java:324)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.SaveManager$1.run(SaveManager.java:153)\nat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.run(InternalPlatform.java:1044)\nat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.run(Platform.java:783)\nat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.SaveManager.broadcastLifecycle(SaveManager.java:156)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.SaveManager.save(SaveManager.java:957)\nat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.DelayedSnapshotJob.run(DelayedSnapshotJob.java:44)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:76)",
    "Thanks for the additional info. Finally figured out what is going on. It is a\nweird race condition. \n\nThe cache is structured as follows:\n\n.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.core.resources\\.projects\\SmokeTest03\\org.eclipse.jem.beaninfo\\\n  .cache\\\n      .index\n      rootn\\\n        aclass.xmi \u003c- the override file.\n\nNormally only .metadata\\...\\org.eclipse.jem.beaninfo\\ directories would be\ncreated by default.\n\nNow the index file is written only on snapshots which Eclipse does a five minute\nintervals, while the aclass.xmi is written one minute after the content has been\nchanged in memory. Normally the aclass.xmi file will be written first because\none minute is less than five minutes. Whent the aclass.xmi file is written it\nuses EMF to write it. EMF is smart enough to create all of the intervening\ndirectories if they are not yet created. But the write of the index doesn\u0027t do\nthat, it just writes it. So normally by the time the write index occurs the\nwrite of the aclass.xmi file has occurred and the directories are there. But if\nthe five minute snapshot interval ends before the one minute aclass interval\nends, then it tries to do the the writeIndex before the directories have been\ncreated and so fails.\n\nSince this is a race condition and the normal case is the other way around I was\nnever able to figure out what was going on because whenever I looked at it\neverything seemed like it should work. But now with this additional info I see\nwhat\u0027s going on and I can add the necessary code to create the directories for\nwriteIndex too.",
    "The fix has been released to HEAD.",
    "I thought it marked it fixed.",
    "Looks good, haven\u0027t seen it since the fix.  Closing for VE 1.1."
