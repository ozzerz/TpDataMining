    "I\u0027m going to really struggle to give you a reliable test case here, but here \ngoes...\n\nIn M8 (and not in any other 3.0 I or M build that I\u0027ve tried), I have found \nthat Eclipse stops building files. I have yet to determine whether this is due \nto length of use, multiple projects, or just some internal state failure.\n\nNothing obvious is reported in the .log file, although I do have multiple \nentries like this:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui.ide 4 4 Apr 04, 2004 23:03:08.109\n!MESSAGE Error accessing marker type\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.resources 4 376 Apr 04, 2004 23:03:08.109\n!MESSAGE Marker id: 68785 not found.\n\n\nThe essential problem manifests itself thus (in my situation):\n\nYou have a multi-project workspace, with a modest amount of interdependencies \nbetween projects. You edit and build (using autobuild, but this also happens \nto a colleague of mine using manual builds), and eventually the builds stop \nhappening.\n\nThe fact that the builds aren\u0027t happening is evident because\na) The progress monitor stops displaying ongoing build activities\nb) Coding warnings/errors fixed do not disappear from the Problems view\nc) There is no noticeable build activity going on (no disk activity, no \nrefresh of Problems view, no decoration changes in Package Explorer etc)\n\nInvoking Clean does nothing; turning off autobuild and manually invoking Build \nAll does nothing\n\nThe only solution is to close and restart Eclipse. Things then return to \nnormal for a little while.\n\nThis is a prevalent problem - to the extent that I essentially consider M8 \nunusable.\n\nTo reiterate, this appears to be a new problem. I have tried all 3.0 milestone \nbuilds, and quite a few of the integration builds, and have never seen this \npreviously",
    "Moving to platform for further investigation.",
    "As you\u0027re the first to report this, and many are using M8, I suspect a localized\nproblem.  First, can you give more details, including:\n\n - What plugins do you have installed outside the ones included in M8?\n - Are these plugin projects, or just normal Java projects?\n - Are the projects shared in a repository (CVS or otherwise)\n - Anything special about your file system (network drive, samba, etc)\n\nIf you can reproduce with any frequency, you can instrument the build mechanism\nto find out if builds are running:\n\n1) Copy the file plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources_3.0.0/.options to the\nEclipse install directory (eclipse/.options).\n\n2) Turn on builder instrumentation flags:\n\norg.eclipse.core.resources/debug\u003dtrue\norg.eclipse.core.resources/build/failure\u003dtrue\norg.eclipse.core.resources/build/invoking\u003dtrue\norg.eclipse.core.resources/build/delta\u003dtrue\norg.eclipse.core.resources/build/needbuild\u003dtrue\n\n3) Start eclipse with the \"-debug\" command line argument, and use java.exe as\nthe VM instead of javaw.exe:\n\n eclipse -vm d:\\java142\\jre\\bin\\java -debug\n\n-\u003e You should now get diagnostics printing in the Java console.  When it gets\ninto a state where builds no longer happen, see if any diagnostics are generated.\n\n",
    "I would be delighted to hear that it was a localised problem, however as it \noccurs on at least 3 machines that I know of, my hopes aren\u0027t high.\n\nI will perform the debugging steps that you suggested, and in the meantime, in \nanswer to your questions:\n\n- I have no other plugins loaded at this time. I started using M8 from a brand \nnew workspace, with a clean, full SDK installation\n- All projects in my workspace are Java only\n- The code for all projects is held in a CVS repository, which I access via \nEclipse\n- My work machine is a dual-processor, dual-monitor Dell running XP Pro, my \nhome machine is a single-processor, single-monitor P4 clone running XP Home.\n\nThese are both machines that I have run all of the other milestone builds on \nwithout this problem.\n\nMy workspace has 24 projects in it - with a modest amount of inter-dependency \nbetween them (nothing too complex, but each is dependent on at least one other)",
    "Thanks for all the details.  Sorry to ask this probably stupid question, but are\nyou sure it isn\u0027t building?  Builds now happen in the background, and the\nprogress shown to the user when a build starts and completes is almost\nnon-existent (see for example bug 52617). When no build is required and you hit\nCtrl+B, build is instantaneous and there is not even a flicker of feedback in\nthe UI. We are working on improving this...",
    "Not a stupid question to ask at all :)\n\nIn trying to prove that I wasn\u0027t just imagining this problem, I set about a \nsort of experiment.\n\nThe projects I\u0027m working on have, over time, acquired a bunch of compiler \nwarnings (non-externalised strings, missing Javadoc etc), and last weekend I \nset about resolving them.\n\nAll began well - I\u0027d correct some issues, save the file(s) and the warning \nindicators and Problem view would update to reflect that those conditions had \nbeen resolved. All of this was accompanied by noticable activity in the \nProgress view\n\nAfter a while, however, the warning indicators, Problem view and Progress view \nall stopped responding. Essentially all signs point to the build not being \ndone.\n\nHaving said that, I\u0027m not too blinkered to admit that it might be something \nelse - and had discussed this with a colleague.\n\nWhat clinches it for me, though, is that when I have got into this situation \nwith compiler errors (not warnings) then I get \"unresolved compilation error\" \nproblems when I run my classes. So it does seem like it is not building.\n\nThat being said, I want to get this resolved more than any other issue, so I\u0027m \noff to do some further experimentation!\n\n\n\n",
    "Well, the best thing is to run with the trace options turned on as I describe.\nThat should print more information than you ever wanted to know about\nif/when/what builds are happening.",
    "I noticed you entered a very similar bug about builds not working in M8 (bug\n56708). Is this the same situation? Are you always getting the build up of\n\"Running Operation\" tasks before the builds fail?  Just trying to gather clues...",
    "Yes, well spotted :)\n\nI do get that, continually - for example, if I check out a project from CVS \nand then open the project properties to complete the dependency configuration.\n\nIt\u0027s difficult to know if the two problems are related or not. The symptoms \nare the same, but in the other issue (56708), there is a build up of entries \nin the Progress view, and in this one, there is not.\n\nThe nett effect is the same, though - it works as it should for a while, and \nthen stops.\n\nI find the other issue (56708) *very* easy to recreate. Open the progress \nview, check out a project, progress view shows stuff and then empties. Open \nproperties and add (for example) an external jar library as a dependent, close \nproperties to allow Eclipse to do its rebuild, and ta-da - a hanging entry is \nleft in the progress view. \n\nAfter a \u0027random\u0027 number of these happening, no further auto-builds take place -\n eg a compilation problem that would be fixed by adding a dependent to the \nproject no longer resolves when I do so.\n\nIt would be very handy if this was related, because it (56708) is much more \npredictable and easy to see :)",

No\nerrors appear in the log, and tracing shows that the builders are no longer being\ncalled at all. When autobuild is turned off, it continues to work normally.\nSometimes this happens after a build up of \"Waiting: Running Operation\" entries\nin the progress view, but not in all cases. At least two people have experienced\nthis.\n\nI\u0027m still stumped, but I have some more questions that might help narrow it down\n(theoretically after twenty questions it better be solved \u003cg\u003e):\n\n1) When you get into this state, do other things that use the progress view\nstill work? For example, do CVS operations and Java Search still work? These\nbackground tasks all use a common infrastructure so this might help narrow the\nproblem.\n\n2) When in this state, can one of you do a Ctrl+Break in the java console (run\nwith java.exe as described in comment #2).  This should produce a stack trace of\nall currently executing threads.  Copy this stack to a file and attach to the\nbug report (see the \"Create a New Attachment\" link at the top of the page).\n\n3) What VM are you using? Do java.exe -version and attach the output.",
    "1. Trying something like a CVS \"Show in Resource History\" still works, but the \nProgress view reports nothing during the process. I even switched the Progress \nview to \"verbose\", but still nothing reported. Ditto with Java Search - the \nfunction works, but the Progress view does not display any activity\n\n2. Thread dump is about to be attached\n\n3. I am using J2SDK 1.4.2_04 - specifically:\njava version \"1.4.2_04\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_04-b05)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_04-b05, mixed mode)\n\n\nI like this 20 question thing :)  I\u0027m a very willing servant to assist you in \nresolving this!",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d9460)\nCtrl+break on Eclipse when autobuild has stopped working\n\nThis has been produced using Eclipse M8, running in debug mode with the\n.options file set to log build activities.\n\nAt the time that this dump was produced, Eclipse had stopped autobuilding on\nresource modification",
    "Reading the report identified as a duplicate of this one, let me report this:\n\nNow I have a workspace setup in which this happens, it can no recur in \nvirtually no time at all - maybe \u003c5 mins with only half-a-dozen or so \nsuccessful save/builds.\n\nThis is on a workspace with multiple project in it, if that might make a \ndifference.\n\nThe situation occurs regardless of whether the build would succeed, fail, or \nproduce warnings.\n\nDoing a dir of the .java and .class files shows (as well as all the other \nevidence) that the .class files are unchanged and out of sync.\n\nAlthough I do have (and have reported) an issue where the Progress view \nacquires non-terminating entries (items get added and do not get removed), \nthis - for me - only happens on initial workspace creation - not during the \nnormal edit/build cycle, so I\u0027m not sure if that is related.",
    "Wow, the thought plickens...\n\nSo once you are in this state, no background operations report progress in the\nprogress view at all?  Try a longer running CVS operation, such as clicking\n\"Synchronize\" in the Synchronize view. The resource history is fast enough that\nit doesn\u0027t always show progress.",
    "I currently have two Eclipse instances running. One where autobuild is still \nfunctional, and one where it is not.\n\nThe one that is still working (only has a couple of projects in it) generates \nstuff in the Progress view on build (auto and manual), CVS and Java Search\n\nThe one that is not working (masses of projects) generates no Progress view \noutput for either auto build (cos it doesn\u0027t do anything!), manual build \n(which seems to work), CVS or Java Search (both of which work as normal)\n\nAs the broken one has wayyy more projects in it, I would have expected more \n(or at least longer-lasting) Progress view output from it...\n\nThe little 3-bar ProgressBar (bottom-right of desktop) behaves sensibly during \nlong operations (build/search/CVS)\n\nSynchronise produced no Progress view output either - although the operation \nitself worked\n\nThis is even with Verbose turned on in Progress view",

    "Ok, last question for the day.  In the Workbench \u003e Work in Progress preference \npage there is a slider bar that is used to give an indication of your machine \nspeed.  Have you touched this slider bar? If you get into a state where builds \nno longer work, does it have any effect to slide this bar all the way to the \nright (Fast)? This preference is used to throttle the amount of background \nactivity that happens concurrently, so that for slow machines we don\u0027t thrash \ntoo much. I\u0027m reaching here, but a bug in this computation could prevent \nbackground operations such as auto-build from running.",
    "I have entered bug 58407 for the IndexOutOfBoundsException in the console \noutput. I\u0027m fairly sure this is unrelated.",
    "Running in a different time zone to you, so apologies for not getting back to \nyou earlier :)\n\nMy machines are already running with the slider on \u0027fast\u0027. I\u0027ll give it a go \non a different \u0027speed\u0027 to see if it has any impact.\n\nI appreciate you sticking with this. I know this doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem \nthat many people have noticed, but it is a major issue to us - and I\u0027d hate to \nhave it persist into 3.0 final release before others start to spot it!",
    "I thought I would add a couple of things that I\u0027ve noticed when this happens to \nme.\n\n- I am using JDK 1.4.1 to compile all of my projects\nC:\\\u003ejava -version\njava version \"1.4.1\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.1-b21)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.1-b21, mixed mode)\n\n- The slider bar for the machine speed is all the way to the right (as fast as \nit can go)\n\n- I have been switching back and forth between M7 and M8, but I can only get \nthis to happen with M8.\n\n- The last time I was able to reproduce this problem was right after I tried \ndebugging my class.  I\u0027m not sure if this is what causes it every time, but I \njust noticed this.  While I was updating my class, everything seemed to be \nworking fine.  Then, I tried running a junit test in debug mode.  After I \nfinished, the progress view would no longer display any information.  The task \nview was no longer being updated as well.  I was able to run a search however.\n",
    "You have both indicated that this is happening (at least sometimes) immediately\nafter launching a Java program in debug mode. It would be useful to know if this\nis consistent. I\u0027ve still had no luck reproducing it here.",
    "I have seen this reproduced using I20040413.  This is a stop-ship defect.",
    "Ian, if you\u0027re still with me you could try the following debug flags:\n\norg.eclipse.core.runtime/debug\u003dtrue\norg.eclipse.core.runtime/jobs\u003dtrue\n\nThen, in the flood of messages in the console, look for this message when you\nget into a state where autobuild does not run:\n\n\"Stopped allocating worker threads. Thread count: \u003csome number\"",
    "Just out of curiosity, where are these debug flags set? ",
    "In the .options file in the eclipse install directory. See comment #2.",
    "Could you both try running with the patch found at:\n\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/platform-core-home/downloads/patches/3.0M8/runtime.jar\n\nJust replace the JAR file at\neclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.0.0/runtime.jar with the one at that\nlink. I recommend keeping a copy of the old JAR just in case. This patch will\nonly work with 3.0 M8 (any operating system).\n\nI\u0027m still baffled at what might be causing it, but this patch adds several extra\nchecks to the code that decides if another background thread needs to be\nallocated (and tries to correct any error condition). This will tell me whether\nor not I\u0027m on the right track with this.",
    "I am still with you on this, John. I put the extra instrumentation details \ninto my .options file, and the damn thing has been good as gold all day - not \na rebuild problem in sight!\n\nI was going to leave trying your new .jar file until the problem happened \nagain, but if you\u0027d prefer me to try it anyway, just let me know...\n\nIn the meantime, I\u0027ll just let you know what happens when the problem recurs",
    "John, have you seen one of the other issues I\u0027ve raised? bug 56708\n\nNot necessarily connected, but in the same general area of \u0027build issues\u0027.\n\nThis still happens 100% consistently whenever I go to one of my projects and \nchange a build dependency (add/remove other project or external library).\n\nThere is a difference here - that issue leaves a tracer in the Progress view, \nbut might be kinda interesting to consider alongside this issues",
    "Re: comment #30 - that is interesting in and of itself.  The fact that it\ndoesn\u0027t fail when instrumentation is enabled certainly suggests a subtle time\nissue or race condition.\n\nRe: comment #31 - I haven\u0027t seen that one either.  I\u0027m not as concerned about\nit, since the code that generated those \"Running Operation\" entries has all been\nchanged (it was a prototype of moving operations from fore-ground to background\nand it had some glitches).",
    "A co-worker of mine is running into this as well.  He is running WinXP (plugins\nare XMLBuddy, and Tomcat... I don\u0027t know what versions).  There is a checkbox on\nthe Workbench-\u003eWork in Progress page to temporarily restore 2.1 build actions\nwhich we set.  This adds a Rebuild All to the Project menu and he was able to\nrebuild the projects via that.  This may be an anomolie, but I thought I would\ndrop it here as food for thought.",
    "I have experienced similar problems with M8 (and with none of the previous 3.0\nbuilds). My system is linux based with Blackdown j2sdk-1.4.1_01 (but the same\nhappens with Sun\u0027s j2sdk-1.4.1_05). For some time everything is ok, but then\neclipse begins to report errors in the problem view (when saving a file) saying\nthat e.g. \"SomeException is not a type\" however SomeException and the class I\u0027m\nediting are in the same package. And of course an Ant build compiles everything\nfine. In my case restarting eclipse doesn\u0027t even help.\nThe only thing that works is commiting everything back into CVS, deleting the\nproject and checking it out again.\n\nMaybe this is another bug, but makes the M8 build very unusable.",
    "We have discovered and fixed quite a few problems since M8 in areas that may be\nrelated to this bug.  As we are getting very close to the 3.0 release, we need\nto know if anyone can reproduce this problem on a newer build.  All components\nhave put in a lot of effort to produce a stable integration build this week in\nlieu of the old M9 milestone.  If you could take this new build (I20040506), and\nlet us know ASAP if you can reproduce this problem, it would be very much\nappreciated.\n\nUntil a reproducible case is discovered on I20040506 or later, I am downgrading\nthe priority of this bug.  \"P1\" means we will not ship Eclipse 3.0 until the\nproblem is fixed, which we cannot promise without knowing for certain if the\nproblem still exists.",
    "I\u0027m afraid that I have got this trouble in I20040506 still - I\u0027ve only been \nable to use it for any length of time for a day, but I have noticed builds not \nhappening in two situations:\n\n1) Building my workspace, which consisted of me CVS checking out 17 projects \ninto one workspace, and then going through each adding external libs and inter-\nproject dependencies. After a while, it just stopped rebuilding/refreshing \nwhen I completed a dependency link. So this was in project properties actions \nonly - no code changes.\n\n2) I have just had the old, familiar not rebuilding after code edit issue \nrecur. I have a Java file open, I\u0027m making changes to it and saving (with auto-\nbuild), but the .class file is not being rebuilt. As before, once the rebuild \nstops working, it doesn\u0027t get going again without a restart.\n\nSorry to be the bearer of bad news, and I will now try and recreate this with \nthe debug tracers turned on to see if I can give more info - but I still think \nthere is an issue...\n\n**Once more, the progress view shows no activity - even in Verbose mode\n\n**This might be nothing related, but I have exceptions like this in my .log \nfile.

    "I am experiencing the same problem with M8: Windows 2000, JDK1.4.2_04, lots of \nprojects and the same symptoms: Suddenly build stops.\nIn that situation also the CVS icon decorations of the files in the project I \nworked on are no longer painted.\n\nSometimes (propability 30%?) when I switched on the verbose flag in the progress \nview, there were a few jobs listed there. All of them were waiting blocked (as \nfar as I remember). Cancelling one or more of the jobs solved the problem in 50% \nof all situations. So there seems to be a deadlock. Restarting Eclipde was the \nonly solution in the other situations.\n\nI have about the same configuration of Eclipse on a different machine with a \ndifferent workspace and do not experience this problem there. The main \ndifference is that the projects have less dependencies and are smaller. So maybe \ncomplexity of the build cycle is an important precondition to reproduce this \nproblem.\n\nUnfortunately I don\u0027t remember the list of jobs that were waiting in the \nprogress view and cancellation of which of them broke the deadlock.

    "Just had it again on I200405140800\n\nWhat was going on was that I was creating interface classes and then gradually \nproviding implementations classes on the interfaces.

Also, I\nrecommend trying with a newer build, such as I20040513-1200, which is a stable\npre-M9 build.",
    "Re: comment #43 - Ok, I switched to the newer build and will open a new bug\nreport in case the problem still occurs.",
    "OK, got a new theory/snippet of information\n\nThe previous suggestion of making the memory allocation larger has no \ninfluence (the problem still occurs, and is still as \u0027random\u0027 as ever).\n\nHowever, and this *could* be relevant, I might have spotted a pattern...\n\nI have a fairly large Java file in my project (1400 lines). This file has \nalready been blamed (by me) for triggering another Eclipse bug (62093).\n\nOn the two most recent situations whether this rebuild problem has occurred \n(both today), it has been immediately after I have made an edit in this file.\n\nIt is equally possible that this is always the case when this happens - it is \na key file in one of my projects.\n\nI don\u0027t think it is happening ever time I edit this file, but, for example, I \nhave just noticed the problem again and the last file that had either an edit \nor a rebuild is this one.\n\nIt would also explain why sometimes it can be a few days before the problem \noccurs, and sometimes only 10 minutes after Eclipse has been launched.\n\nI might be completely off-beam here, but if there is something that Eclipse \ndoesn\u0027t like about this file (see issue 62093) - maybe its too large, or too \ncomplex, or something, then I would be quite prepared to believe that it is \nresponsible for all of the times that this has happened to me.\n\nHope that this isn\u0027t too whacky an idea, but I have noticed other issues with \nthis file, so it is obviously slightly unpalatable for Eclipse, eg:\n- broken highlighting\n- broken indents (cursor will sometimes fail to auto-indent on [Enter]\n- broken auto-complete (ctrl+space sometimes does nothing)\n- incorrect report of \u0027missing\u0027 files (see issue 58986), which has only ever \nhappened on references made in this class\n\nHmmm...\n\nIf you want a look at the file, I attached it to 62093\n\n",
    "Ian: a promising lead. I have not been able to reproduce a problem with your\nfile, but of course it won\u0027t compile correctly in my environment due to missing\nprerequisites. It might just be a piece of your configuration that is\ncontributing to the problem. On the theory that a large file might be causing\nit, I created a 20KB Java file with 120 inner types, 100 members, and 100\nfields. It is certainly sluggish, but no errors (just don\u0027t try to comment big\nfiles, see bug 62662).",

    "I have entered bug 64162 for the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n\nThe extra debug info is useful. This is the interesting line:\n\nWed May 26 03:20:03 BST 2004 - [main] Build requested, needsBuild: true state: \nSLEEPING delay: 100\n\nIt means the build was correctly requested to run in 100 milliseconds, and that\nthe autobuild job is currently sleeping. This eliminates several possible theories:\n\n1) The build might be scheduled for an unreasonably large delay\n2) The build was not requested\n3) The build is already running and somehow stuck.\n\nI\u0027m still mystified about how, once requested, the build job is not running,\nwhen clearly other jobs are still successfully running. I\u0027ll have to think some\nmore.",
    "Ian, next time this occurs, try this:\n\n1) Open the progress view (double-click in lower right hand corner of window)\n2) In the drop down menu, turn on \"Verbose mode\".\n3) See if there is a sleeping \"Building workspace\" job\n4) If there is, click the cancel button on it.\n\nDoes this make things work again?",
    "I\u0027ve been experiencing very similar problems to what Ian has described.  In M8\nthey were sporadic, but in M9 I\u0027m seeing them quite frequently (lately, at least\nseveral times a day).  The only workaround seems to be quitting and restarting\neclipse.  Note I did a clean install of M9 and started with a fresh workspace.\n\nSome of the symptoms:\n\nThe error decorators and problems view get out of sync.  Errors that are fixed\ndo not go away, even when the offending code is commented out.  Build clean\nsometimes fixes it, but more often than not quitting and restarting eclipse is\nnecessary.\n\nCVS decorators occasionally disappear, and any Team functionality is disabled\nuntil I quit and restart.\n\nSearching for references fails to find any matches, until I quit and restart.\n\nWhen launching a debug runtime workbench, sometimes a dialog comes up that says\na build is in progress, when nothing is happening.  If I choose to wait for the\nbuild to finish it just waits forever.  In the progress view with verbose on,\nsometimes there are either no building jobs or occasionally a job stuck at 100%.\n\nClicking on a java file in Package Explorer opens the wrong file (usually the\nfile above or below the one I want).  This one may be an unrelated SWT bug.\n\nI\u0027ve turned on the debug options as discussed in the earlier comments.  What\nshould I be looking for?  I can post debug info the next time I experience a\nproblem.\n\n-Chris",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d11251)\nZipped job examples plugin\n\nOk, some more low tech debugging tools.

    "I\u0027ve just tried to perform the steps in comment #54\n\nI opened the Progress view, and it is empty\nI switched into Verbose mode, and it is still empty\n\nInterestingly, I then turned off autobuild, did a clean with \"start a build \nimmediately\" turned on. The build happened (as evidenced by lots of consoleLog \nactivity, and the .class files being recreated), but the Progress view stayed \nempty the entire way through (this is a large workspace and the build took  \n30+ seconds)\n\nI\u0027ll restart Eclipse, and have the Progress view open from the outset and see \nwhat it looks like if it happens again\n",
    "With great drama, I believe we have identified and fixed this bug, within\nminutes of the first Eclipse 3.0 candidate build! \n\nSleeping jobs are inserted into a priority queue, and worker threads \"peek\" at\nthe queue to see if the first job should start running. There was a condition in\nwhich a job could have its wake priority changed without the queue being\nreshuffled. This could result in a job with a distant future wake time to be at\nthe head of the sleep queue. Worker threads would peek at this job, and then\ngive up after observing that the wake time had not yet been reached. Meanwhile,\nother jobs further back in the sleep queue could be well past their wake time.\n\nThe fix was to ensure the sleep queue is always resorted when a job changes it\ndesired wake time (this was happening in most cases, but in one case it was missed).\n\nIan\u0027s recent debug trace showing a load of SLEEPING jobs tipped us off that some\njobs were sleeping that should have already run. Thanks to Ian for giving us\nthis timely information!\n\nThe fix made it (just barely) into the noon EDT 3.0 RC1 build. This build is\nrunning now and will be available within the hour. If people experiencing this\nproblem could move up to this new build, it would be greatly appreciated.",
    "For those who have not yet tried a build from today, it is probably better to\nwait for the 8PM EDT build. It will contain a fix for another critical bug (bug\n64540).\n\nThe 8PM build, however, will be good, or your money will be refunded :)\n\nI will keep this bug open until I receive independent verification (aka a thumbs\nup from Mr. Brown).",
    "Sadly, oh-so-sadly, I find myself running I200405290105 and still having this \nproblem...\n\nAs I was flush with confidence, I am running without debug options on, so I \ncan\u0027t tell you much about the state. What I can see is a Progress view that \nhas 103 (!) entries in it saying \"Building workspace (Waiting)\", and 5 entries \nthat say \"Building workspace\" with a progress bars that are 50-70% across\n\nWill play around and see if this will recreate with debug instrumentation on",
    "In response to comment #54, I have been through the Progress view.\n\nThere are no \u0027sleeping\u0027 Build workspace jobs.\n\nI\u0027ve tried cancelling all Build workspace jobs, but to no avail (and indeed, \nno difference at all).",
    "Since my last report, I\u0027ve been using the same build, running in Debug mode \nwith the instrumentation options on. It has been continually running since my \nlast report - and I\u0027ve been using it for several hours.\n\nNo problems have occurred. Although the Progess view is filling up pretty \nquickly as its \u0027up\u0027 time has increased. Switching in and out of verbose mode \nreduces the list, but there seems to be a sluggishness creeping in. But, as I \nsay, it is behaving itself with regard to rebuilds.\n\nI\u0027m now dropping back to non-debug, and have just the Jobs dump available for \nif something goes wrong. Watch this space... :)",
    "(\u0026^%#$!\n\nIt sounds like you are now seeing different problems, so perhaps we\u0027ve fixed one\nand uncovered another. It sound like you can easily reproduce the build up of\nwaiting build operations regardless of whether it gets into a state where it\nstops working? If this is true, a sample of your job debug output would be\ninteresting to see (similar to comment #39).",
    "OK, just had the autobuild fail happen again. This time (as before) in non-\ndebug mode.

Although the sub-\ntext says \"Build done\", the progress bar is looping round and round.\n\nI\u0027m going to try cancelling this task and see what effect it has...\n\n",
    "Attempting to stop any of the jobs mentioned in my previous comment (including \nthe one that was looping around) had no impact - the task stayed present and \nvisible and had no determinable impact.\n\nIt seems to be less prevalent than it was in M8, but is still happening at \nleast once a day on average - and it always takes me a least 30 mins of hair \npulling before I realise that this is why my code changes aren\u0027t fixing \nwhatever it is I\u0027m working on!\n\nI\u0027ll go back to debug mode now and see if I can get you some job output",

    "I still see this in RC1.\n\nPlease notice the dump of the job manager in comment 57 and comment 65. It\u0027s \nsimilary for me. The first item is always \"Decoration Calculation\" which is \nsleeping and all other jobs (building etc.) are sleeping, too. After canceling \nthe first task (\"Decoration Calculation\"), all things start working fine again.\n\nNote that after enabling \"Verbose\" mode in the Progess view I have to close \nand reopen the view to see any changes.",
    "I think there are two possibly unrelated problems:\n\n1) Progress view showing stale entries\n2) A rare condition that causes jobs to remain indefinitely in sleeping state.\n\nWe have seen several reports of 1), although not nearly as severe as what Ian\nobserves. 2) needs further investigation.",
    "Interesting thought!\n\nOn all machines that I know have experienced this problem are dual processor.\n\n(apart from my home machine, but that is a hyperthreaded one which appears to \nthe OS as a dual processor).\n\nIf this is a threading/timing issue, this may be significant...???",
    "Same for me. HyperThreading CPU (P4 2,8 GHz) that simulates 2 CPUs for Windows \nXP.",
    "I haven\u0027t seen this problem since I switched to RC1 yet.  However, I too am \nusing a dual processor.",
    "Well, that\u0027s certainly interesting news. The only member of the Eclipse team\nfacing similar problems is also using a dual-processor Windows box. I use a\ndual-processor Linux box and have not seen the problem. Timing problems and\nconcurency bugs are often exacerbated on dual processor machines because the VMs\nare more aggressive about making use of thread-local caches. I will review the\ncode again with this in mind.",
    "Ines has seen similar problems on the Mac in RC1. Ines can you provide details \nplease?",
    "Unfortunately, I was not able to reproduce the \"Error accessing marker type\"\nissue. But here are my steps if it helps:\n\nI am using build id 200406040800 on Mac OS 10.3.3.\n\n- Check out \"org.eclipse.ui.carbon\"\n- Wait for the build to finish. Once the errors appear in the problems view, go\ncheck out \"org.eclipse.swt\"\n- Run the operation in the background\n- Switch to the \"Navigator View\"\n- As soon as you see the \"org.eclispe.swt\" project appear, rename SWT\u0027s\nclasspath_carbon to classpath\n- The progress dialog shows up (showing the CVS operation and refactoring jobs)\n- When both jobs were finished, I noticed that the errors were not gone in the\nproblems view, but they were gone in the java file\n- Clicking on the errors in the problems view generated the \"Error accessing\nmarker type\" message in the log\n- Re-building would not respond\n- I had to restart for everything to rebuild",
    "Just as a potentially useful hint, the last few times that this has happened \nto me, the topmost item in the \u0027jobs\u0027 list (from John\u0027s Jobs plugin) has been \nDecoration Calculation\n\nThis might mean nothing - I don\u0027t know if the list is in any particular order -\n but it would be remiss of me not to mention it if it gives you a clue...",

    "For those still experiencing this in 3.0 RC1, there is a chance that the fix for\nbug 66168 is related to this. I\u0027m not optimistic at this stage, but I would\nencourage everyone to try 3.0 RC2 when it comes out tomorrow to see if the\nproblem still happens.",

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d12693)\nNew diagnostic plugin zip\n\nThe attached zip contains an improved plugin that will print more diagnostic\ninformation about the state of the job manager. The Job \u003e Dump Job Information\naction will print a bunch of information on the Java console. If anyone gets\nback into the state where jobs are not running, this dump information would be\nvery useful to see. As a bonus, this plugin also contains an action, Job \u003e Wake\nup Jobs, that should get you out of this broken state. I would be very keen to\nhear if this works for those having this problem. At the very least it should\nbe a band-aid that helps people keep working until we have a real fix\navailable.",
    "Ian, and others still experiencing this problem: I believe we have just fixed\nit. See bug 68452 for more details.\n\nWe are fast approaching the 3.0 build, so we\u0027re looking for as many verifiers as\npossible. The fix will appear in today\u0027s 4PM EDT build. This build is likely to\nbe the final Eclipse 3.0 release (with the exception of documentation changes).\nIf you could all run with this build, and follow up here with results, that\nwould be *greatly* appreciated. Hyperthreading and dual-processor results would\nbe particularly interesting. I will mark this fixed next week if I hear no\nnegative results on today\u0027s 4pm build or the final Eclipse 3.0 release.",
    "The behaviour described in Bug 67594 seems to be corrected in 3.0 release.",
