    "Using wtp-all-inone-sdk-R-1.5.0 and Tomcat 5.0.18\n\nWhen I add CredCriteria project to my Tomcat server, it adds\n\u003cContext docBase\u003d\"CredCriteria\" path\u003d\"/credcriteria\" reloadable\u003d\"true\" source\u003d\"org.eclipse.jst.j2ee.server:CredCriteria\"/\u003e to server.xml and generates following exception when server is started:\nSEVERE: Error starting static Resources\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Document base C:\\eclipse 3.2 Web workspace\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\\tmp0\\webapps\\CredCriteria does not exist or is not a readable directory\n\tat org.apache.naming.resources.FileDirContext.setDocBase(FileDirContext.java:185)\n\tat org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext.resourcesStart(StandardContext.java:3858)\n\nI can comment this out and manually add the following and it works (debugger breakpoints also work):\n\u003cContext docBase\u003d\"c:/eclipse 3.2 Web workspace/CredCriteria\" path\u003d\"/credcriteria\" reloadable\u003d\"true\"/\u003e\n\nNeed to fix so adding a project to the server generates a context that works.\n\nNote: Although this is a minor bug, it can be very time consuming to determine the cause/solution and fix manually.",
    "Pointing to the workspace (c:/eclipse 3.2 Web workspace/CredCriteria) will fail in some situations since the workspace project doesn\u0027t always have the regular J2EE web structure in place. The relative path that it is pointing to when running (C:\\eclipse 3.2 Web\nworkspace\\.metadata\\.plugins\\org.eclipse.wst.server.core\\tmp0\\webapps\\CredCriteria) should contain a published version of the entire module.\n\nThis works fine on my Tomcat 5.0.25. Can you check the second directory above to see whether the directory exists or if there are any problems with the contents?",

I probably won\u0027t be able to work on this going forward because we have switched to using MyEclipse which uses a different mechanism and I\u0027m losing my familiarity with this situation from not using the product.  So you may want to just close the bug out if you can\u0027t re-create the problem to fix it.  Thanks.\n",
