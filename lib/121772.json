    "I get a class cast exception when I open a file from the navigator. The problem is that there is a cast to StructuredSelection instead of IStructuredSelection in the ResourceNavigator class (and the object being cast is a TreeSelection). Here are the interesting lines of the trace.\n\nCaused by: java.lang.ClassCastException: org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TreeSelection incompatible with org/eclipse/jface/viewers/StructuredSelection\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.views.navigator.ResourceNavigator$8.run(ResourceNavigator.java:726)",
    "Fix released \u003e20051221.",
    "[I20060214-0800]\n\nVerfied by looking at the code in the imported ide plug-in."
