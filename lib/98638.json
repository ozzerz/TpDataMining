    "N20050607-0010\n\nI can no longer launch any target from my dev workspace. Also tried adding a new\nEclipse launch config but no luck.\n\nDid what I always do with a new drop:\n1. installed N20050607-0010 to fresh dir\n2. started my existing dev workspce\n3. imported existing unshared plug-ins as binary project from N20050607-0010\n   (not linked)\n4. started my target\n\u003d\u003d\u003e doesn\u0027t come up\n\nHere\u0027s how to reproduce this out of the box:\n\n1. install N20050607-0010 to fresh directory\n2. start fresh workspace\n3. import org.eclipse.jdt.ui and all required plug-ins as binary projects from \n   N20050607-0010 (not linked)\n   NOTE: the scenario works if I install ALL plug-ins\n4. On the PDE Target Platform preference page disable all external plug-ins\n5. create a new Eclipse Application launch config\n   \u003d\u003d\u003e application \"org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\" is chosen as program\n6. Run\n\u003d\u003d\u003e doesn\u0027t start, see .log below\n\nNOTE: same scenario works just fine using N20050606-0010 even if I import from\nN20050606-0010.\n\n!SESSION 2005-06-07 10:26:59.348 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dunknown\njava.version\u003d1.5.0_03\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003dde_CH\nFramework arguments:  -application org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench -pdelaunch\nCommand-line arguments:  -application org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench -data\nc:\\eclipse\\drops\\N20050607-0010\\runtime-workspace -dev\nfile:c:/eclipse/drops/N20050607-0010/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/New_configuration/dev.properties\n-pdelaunch -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-06-07 10:27:00.350\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Application \"org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\" could not\nbe found in the registry.

    "Well, your platform.xml looks bad.  It only lists org.apache.ant.  No wonder \nyou couldn\u0027t launch.",

The only changes that went into the configurator were those \nrelated to relative paths, but, to me, this looks like a slightly different \nproblem. I think the PDE team should also look at their usage of the update \nAPI, to make sure things are invoked correctly, especially with respect to \npaths.",
    "Wassim, one problem that may be the causethis is related to the recent change in\nPDE to avoid duplicating sites when the device letter changes.\n\nThe paths are being normalized when the local sites are created, but the\ncomparison that decides whether a new site is needed is not doing the same. So\nit ends up trying to add every plug-in in the workspace to a different site\n(with the same actual URL). Update will silently refuse any of the additional\nsites, so the configuration has only one of the plug-ins from the workspace.",
    "The first paragraph in the comment above should read:\n\n\"Wassim, this is related to the recent change in PDE to avoid duplicating sites\nwhen the device letter changes.\"\n\nI could verify that adding the following two lines at the beginning of\nTargetPlatform#addToSite fixes the problem.\n\nif (path.getDevice() !\u003d null)\n  path \u003d path.setDevice(path.getDevice().toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH));\t\t\n \t",
    "The problem is only reproducible if the workspace is on FAT32 (that seems to\naffect the the case for device letters). Has anyone seen this with an workspace\non NTFS?",
    "The file system thing might be a red herring. Jerome was seeing the same problem\non NTFS (bug 98650).",
    "Mine is NTFS.",
    "*** Bug 98650 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "what about device name?  I am running on D and I don\u0027t see the problem.",
    "I am running on \"D\" as well. In my case, the site path for plug-ins in the\nworkspace have a lowercase \"d\".",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d22521)\nPlatform.xml\n\nI am really puzzled by the randomness of it all.\nDoing Dani\u0027s scenario on a fresh 0607 install, this is the platform.xml I get. \nIt looks and runs fine.  Note the uppercase D.",
    "In any event, the two lines in comment 10 should certainly be there regardless.\nI just released that code to close this bug.\n\nOf course, we would have none of these problems and we would not need all \nthese workarounds for IPath comparisons if bug 49516 were addressed one way or \nanother.",
    "Are the site paths PDE maintains built from\nIProject.getLocation().removeLastSegments(1)? I noticed in my workspace the\nproject path has a lower case device letter, but in Pascal\u0027s case (he could not\nreproduce the problem), project location paths had upper case device letters.",
    "For workspace plugins, yes.",
    "The trigger is the way you provide you workspace location. The path provided\nthere is the base for file system paths provided by using IResource.getLocation().",
    "Yes, I have problem if I launch with -data d:... and not when with -data D:..."
