    "I had tried again with a clean workspace and I can\u0027t actually profile the application.

    "Eugene, could you please look into this?",
    "I have seen this error message in the past.  I assume you\u0027re running AC/IAC with security enabled.  Last time, I remember it was a configuration issue on my machine.  Something was wrong either with my PATH or CLASSPATH.  I don\u0027t remember exactly what I did to resolve it.  It seems like the exception is thrown by the JVM when it\u0027s not able to find the crypto algorithm specified.  See here: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/security/MessageDigest.html#getInstance(java.lang.String)\n\nTry switching to an IBM JVM.  If it works, checks to see the difference in the configuration of the two JVMs.",
    "I am running with the new IAC; I checked on the AC page and the security is reported to be off ( I made no attempt to change the default settings prior to starting the profiling session )",
    "After more investigation I realized the exception occurs with both sun and IBM jre 1.5 but only if I run with java.exe. Everything works fine when I run with javaw.exe\n\nIn other words, I can reproduce the problem if I run eclipse with a console using this command\neclipse -vm D:\\ProgramFiles\\Java\\IBM_SDK5.0\\bin\\java.exe\n\nEverything works fine if I run without a debug console, using eclipse.exe ( which by default uses javaw.exe )\n\nI\u0027ll update severity to critical since profiling when running Eclipse with a console doesn\u0027t work",
    "I have the same problem when running with java 1.4",
    "(In reply to comment #4)\n\u003e I am running with the new IAC; I checked on the AC page and the security is\n\u003e reported to be off ( I made no attempt to change the default settings prior to\n\u003e starting the profiling session )\n\u003e \n\nIt might have been a different problem I experienced then.",
    "I have tried to reproduce the problem on 2 different machines with both IBM and SUN 1.5 JDK, and I cannot reproduce the problem as described.\n\nValentina also tried again on her machine and even thought exception (as in description) still shows on her console, she no longer have problem profiling, nor relaunching. Data are collected with no problem. We suspect it may be the setup of her machine\u0027s environment that triggers the problem. \n\n\nIt\u0027s agreed by the originator that I will lower the severity of this bug and target post 4.4 release for now."
