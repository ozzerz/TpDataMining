    "Build ID: I20070625-1500\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nI have an Ant script that simply runs an AGR test suite. When I invoke the script from the workbench, one time out of two I get the following NullPointerException that is caused by the test harness not finding some class. The class that is not found varies, but essentially the exception and the stack trace that are generated are always like the one below:\n\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: IWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:C:\\projects\\Etish-33_for_agr\\com.etish.agr\\bin\\com\\etish\\agr\\util\\TestLogger.class (The system cannot find the path specified)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.hyades.test.core.launch.delegates.AbstractLaunchConfigurationDelegate2.launch(AbstractLaunchConfigurationDelegate2.java:195)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:766)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:608)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:601)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.hyades.test.core.services.AbstractTestExecutionService.launch(AbstractTestExecutionService.java:719)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.hyades.test.core.services.AbstractTestExecutionService.execute(AbstractTestExecutionService.java:522)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.hyades.automation.server.AbstractService.execute(AbstractService.java:43)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.hyades.automation.server.ServiceProxy$1.run(ServiceProxy.java:141)\n[tptp:execution]     at org.eclipse.hyades.automation.core.utils.ReusableThread.run(ReusableThread.java:131)\n[tptp:execution]     at java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n\nBUILD FAILED\nC:\\projects\\Etish-33_for_agr\\com.etish.useme.client.editor.test\\scripts\\CloseDocument.xml:33: java.lang.NullPointerException \n\nWhen the script falls over, about 70% of the times it is accompanied by an unrecoverable corruption of my Eclipse workspace.\n\nMore information:\nUsing TPTP 4.4 and Eclipse Europa.",
    "Barbara,\n\nIt is very unusual (at least to me) that we would be unable to find the classfile for a test we\u0027re trying to run.  How did you get the project into your workspace?  Whether you pulled it from source control, imported it from an existing location, or created there from scratch, I would expect that autobuild would have created the classfile before you were able to exit the full eclipse using this workspace.  I have filed a bug 199135 which discusses autobuild failing during a headless run, but I can only see that causing a problem if you have disabled autobuild when you put the project into the workspace.\n\nWhen you get this failure, does the classfile actually exist in the location referenced in the exception?\n\nNote that I have added a new service in 4.4.1 to import projects into the workspace using ASF, and it builds all the projects before returning.  I hope to write the doc soon -- attached below is a sample usage:\n\n  \u003ctarget name\u003d\"import.projects\"\u003e\n\t\u003ctptp:importExistingProjects\u003e\n\t        \u003cfileset dir\u003d\"${testprojects.dir}\"\u003e\n        \t      \t\u003cinclude name\u003d\"**/*.project\" /\u003e             \n\t\t\u003c/fileset\u003e\n\t\u003c/tptp:importExistingProjects\u003e\n  \u003c/target\u003e\n",
    "Joe,\n\nI created my test plugins in the workspace from scratch. Yes, I do have autobuild turned on and the class files that are not found are actually where they are supposed to be.\n\nAs I said, this is not a constant problem. Classes are found and things work as expected 50% of the time. I am not sure how to go about documenting this further. The only thing I can think of is that I am using a hierarchy of test plugins, with my application testing plugins using common services (and test suites) that reside in a common plugin. I recall frequently seeing that the classes not being found were the ones located in that common plugin (as is the case for the stack trace I included here), but I cannot say for certain that this is *always\" true.\n\nThanks for the pointer to the new service you are including in 4.4.1.",
    "Based on newsgroup discussion, I believe that this is caused by 200194.  Marking this as a dupe, and once 200194 is fixed, you can validate this.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 200194 ***"
