    "In the particular project attached, artifact is created but not associated with \nany test suite. Thus, during deployment, this manually created artifact and \npair is not used. Instead, a new pair created in memory with the test suite and \nlocalhost is being used. (if the manually created location is a remote machine, \nyou should find the test is still being executed on local machine because of \nthis reason.)\n\nIn this senario, there does exist a problem with the deployment adapter not \nretrieving classpath properties. This is fixed and checked in. Test execution \nenvironment is verified to have classpath properly set to it. Deployment part \nof the job is successfully completed.\n\nHowever, test execution still fails. This needs further investigation.\n\n",
