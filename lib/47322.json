    "When starting Eclipse M5 on my machine is get this Error:\n\nD:\\eclipse\u003ejava -cp startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.isAlreadyRunning(Main.java:1504)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:597)\n\nI use this virtual machine:\n\nD:\\eclipse\u003ejava -version\njava version \"1.3.1_03\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.3.1_03-b03)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.1_03-b03, mixed mode)\n\nWhen using this JDK:\n\nD:\\eclipse\u003ev:\\opt\\jdk1.4.2\\bin\\java.exe -version\njava version \"1.4.2\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2-b28)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2-b28, mixed mode)\n\nI started Eclipse M5 using this command:\n\nD:\\eclipse\u003ev:\\opt\\jdk1.4.2\\bin\\java.exe -cp startup.jar\norg.eclipse.core.launcher.Main\n\nOnly the .config and workspace directories are created but nothing happens, no\nerror nothing. Eclipse does not start.\n\nNote:\nPrevious version M4 had the same problem on my machine at work. At home however\nM4 works fine, using JDK 1.3.1 as well (might not be 1.3.1_03 exactly. I do not\nremember). I still have to test M5 back home.",
    "Running Eclipse M5 on JDK 1.4.2 a second time a v2Config file appeared in the\ndirectory \u0027.config\\platform.cfg.metadata\u0027. Running Eclipse another time suddenly\nworks and shows the IDE errorless.\n\nSo the workaround is running the program several times without knowing what it\ndoes on 1.4.",
    "Only just found out that Eclipse should be run on JDK 1.4.1 and up. Would be\nhandy if this would be noted in the readme for the 3.0 version. Only target\nplatforms are noted for Eclipse 2.1.",
    "Yes, we plan on both updating the README file (which currently states that it is\na copy of 2.1 and not a 3.0 file) and the error message that you get when you\nstart up.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 44814 ***"
