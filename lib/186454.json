    "I hit a few odd behaviors when I was experimenting with the JMX agent.  I simply profiled an external Java application (StartStop) using the \"Java Management Extension Analysis\":\n\n1) When I double click the profiling agent associated with the process, I get the following error message:\n\njavax.naming.ServiceUnavailableException\nnull\n\njava.io.IOException: Failed to retrieve RMIServer stub: javax.naming.ServiceUnavailableException [Root exception is java.rmi.ConnectException: Connection refused to host: localhost; nested exception is:\njava.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect]\n  at javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnector.connect(RMIConnector.java:332)\n  at javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory.connect(JMXConnectorFactory.java:263)\n...\n\nMy process name changes in the profiling monitor view and a new agent is created under it.  \n\n2) A new agent is created everytime I double click the profiling agent.\n\n3) When I right click on the \"Managed Agent\" process, I don\u0027t get any options for deleting the process.",

    "Add manual test case for jmx analysis type.\n1. Opening MAX form the JMX analysis type, process, or agent make sure only one MAX is opened.\n2.  Make sure the process and agent name do not change.",
    "Fix checked into head. For every model mbean that is opened with MAX a new entry is created.  There is a defect 173541 to fix this issue."
