    "I20070322-1800\n\nIType#getMethod(..) should not throw an AFE when the method name contains a dot. It should just create a method handle for a method that does not exist.\n\nFrom bug 178190:\n\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.AssertionFailedException: assertion failed: \n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isTrue(Assert.java:109)\n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isTrue(Assert.java:95)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.SourceMethod.\u003cinit\u003e(SourceMethod.java:34)\n        at\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.SourceType.getMethod(SourceType.java:368)\n\nSame problem with BinaryMethod.",
    "I think you should just remove the assertions. They\u0027re not spec\u0027d, and removing them would allow our friends in bug 178190 to rerun JUnit tests more easily.",
