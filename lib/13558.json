    "preconditions are not checked in this scenatio\nso fChangeManager is null\nnasty - opt to fix asap",
    "it is a result of the recent validateEdit changes\n\nsome posibilities of fix - if it is to be fix quickly:\n\nA. do not use validateEdit in this refactoring - go back to the old code \n(cons: known - clear case users are unhappy,\npros: easy to do)\n\nB. do call validateEdit and quietly fail if there\u0027s a read-only file that is to \nbe changed (just perform nothing in such a case)\n(pros: we keep validateEdit in the \u0027preview\u0027 scenario \nand it mostly works in the non-preview one because read-only files are rare\n\ncons: quietly failing)\n\nC. force users to see the preview\npros: relatively easy to fix\ncons: non-preview ui in dnd is desirable\n\nD. remove the update reference smartness\n\nThe Real Fix would be to be able to show the error page after problems \nwith dnd as well\n\ni guess i opt for B\n",
    "This refactoring is an important function of Eclipse. We propose to fix it for \nM5. Given that this drop should enable clear case users we should do option B.",
    "i can do better than B - if there are read-only files, simply no references \nwill be updated, but the file will be moved nonetheless",
    "was partially fixed for 20020412, should fully fix for M6",
