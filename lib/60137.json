    "No data in the method statistics view when attaching to the Java profiling \nagent in enabled mode.\n\nThe same problem exists event when the JIT is disabled.\n\nInstructions to reproduce:\n\n1. Launch HeapJdniCarTest in enabled mode:\n\tjava -classpath . -XrunpiAgent:server\u003denabled HeapJniCarTest\n\n2. Attach and start monitoring HeapJniCarTest.  ENSURE that the \"Show instance-\nlevel information\" check box IS checked on the Profiling Options window.\n3. Perform a heap dump by clicking the \u0027Collect object references\u0027 button\n4. Press enter until the program terminates\n5. Open the method statistics view and verify that no data is present in the \nview.",

    "I get an exception:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Engine\n        at HeapJniCarTest.\u003cinit\u003e(HeapJniCarTest.java:38)\n        at HeapJniCarTest.main(HeapJniCarTest.java:48)",
    "Paul, did you select the Execution Time Analysis profiling type? The method \nstatistics view shows execution times for methods, and will only be present if \nthat type is enabled. Collecting object references won\u0027t affect this view, as \nit\u0027s not related to memory.",
    "Yes.",
    "Curtis, can you please make sure we have the proper options send to RAC, I \nthink we are. Assuming we have the correct options sent, the RAC doesn\u0027t seem \nto send us the methodDef information, by profile to file and look into the \nprofile file.",

    "Confirmed. I get no data at all. Trace file does not contain any method \nentries/exits. Investigating further..",
    "Marius, can you see whether the loaders are receiving any data from the RAC? My \ntrace file\u0027s XML seems to be incomplete (no closing TRACE tag) when I profile \nto a file.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d10021)\nprofile file (not zipped)\n",
    "This seems to be a profiler problem. The trace doesn\u0027t contain any methodDef, \nmethodEntry or methodExit events.",
    "Isn\u0027t this exactly what\u0027s expected? The last step of the test case says:\n\n5. Open the method statistics view and verify that no data is present in the \nview.\n\nThere is no data, as expected... .  (In particular, no data has even be collected.) \n\nThe reason this is the case is because the user attaches to the program after\nthe first (and only) method entry takes place (in the main method). After\nattaching, the profiler will only receive notification of the method exit event\nof the main method, but we cannot print this out to the trace since we never saw\nthe method entry. Unless other method entry/exit pairs take place between the\ntime you\u0027ve attached and the time the program terminates, you won\u0027t see anything\nin the method stats view. ",
    "Confirmed as invalid.  This defect was due to an old test class.\n\nBullet 5 refers the verifying the test to reproduce to this defect, hence no \ndata in the method statistics view."
