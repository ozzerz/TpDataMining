    "Calling a get task after a java task hangs ant.  It works fine running ant from the commandline. \n\nI\u0027ve notice this since 3.1 came out. It may have been a problem earlier.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d36753)\nbuild.xml that hangs ant in eclipse.\n\nMoving the get call above the java call works.  Removing the java call works. In this order, it doesn\u0027t work.",

    "If it\u0027s any help, this only happens when I run ant as a Seperate JRE. When I select \"Run in the same JRE as the workspace\" it doesn\u0027t have the problem.  Unfortunately on my bigger builds, this freezes eclipse.\n\nHere is my output when run in the same JRE.\n\n\ntest:\n        [java] Test Ouput\n         [get] Getting: http://www.google.com\n         [get] To: C:\\dev\\test\\google\n         [get] ..\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nTotal time: 1 second\n",
    "I am unable to reproduce this problem...sorry.\n\nAre you up to attempting to debug the problem so we can figure out the issue?\nWe can set the Ant build to be debuggable to figure out what is failing and where.\n\nIf you set the following to be vm arguments for the separate JRE build:\n-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler\u003dNONE -Xrunjdwp:transport\u003ddt_socket,server\u003dy,suspend\u003dy,address\u003d8000\n\nthe Ant build execution will wait until a debugger connects to it.\n\nYou would need to import the org.apache.ant plugin into your workspace and set a breakpoint in the Get.execute() method before initiating the build.\n\nThen to connect the Eclipse debugger to the build:\nRun\u003eDebug...\u003eRemote Java Application\nClick the New button\n(Defaults should be good)\nClick Debug",
    "It looks like it hangs on Inet4AddressImpl.lookupAllHostAddr(String). This is called indirectly by HttpURLConnection.connect(). (I\u0027ll include a picture of the stack trace).\n\nI\u0027ve noticed that all the forked threads are still active at this point. They are not active when it is run in the same workspace JRE.\n\nMy guess is that there are problems with the fork not being cleaned up correctly and connect() is waiting on a locked resource.\n\nLet me know if there is any other info or debugging I can provide that would be helpful.",

    "When calling a the Java taskdef with fork \u003d true...\n\nShould the thread be removed from the debug windows thread list after the process.waitFor() call in Execute.waitFor(Process).  The exitValue I get is zero, but the thread sticks around. I tried calling process.destroy() explicitely as well but it is still there (I assume nothing is happening because it was already terminated when waitFor returned).\n\nWhen is the thread removed for your forked call?",

    "Ouch...I did not know they no longer had the nightly builds up.\nI have not build Ant from source.\nI will see if I can get to it today...but I have seen indications in the past that building Ant is less than trivial.",

    "Marking as invalid as not a bug in the Eclipse Ant integration but rather a bug in the Apache Ant implementation.\n\nThank you very much Darwin for taking the time to track this down."
