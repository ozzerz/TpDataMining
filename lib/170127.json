    "Background:  I just installed Eclipse v3.2.1 after having used v3.0.1 for over a year.  The new version is running on a MacBook Pro running Mac OS 10.4.8.\n\nIn the new version, all messages to the Console are missing from the scrollable text area of the Console view, but instead appear as a single line in the grey stripe just below the Console tab.  A pdf image showing the problem is available.\n\nThis configuration makes version 3.2.1 unusable for me, thus the elevation to \"major\" severity.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d56730)\nThe message, \"\u003cterminated\u003e common build.xml [Ant Build] ...\" was written to Console subtitle instead of text space.\n\n",
    "After looking at my old Eclipse v3.0.1 installation, I want to re-characterize the problem.  The message \"\u003cterminated\u003e common build.xml ...\" is properly shown in the view subtitle under the Console tab.  What\u0027s wrong is that no proper console message that should appear in the text content area is showing up.\n\nIf there is some option to turn off Console output in Eclipse, it should not be the installation default.  If it\u0027s not the default, then there is something wrong with the Mac installation itself.  - RK",
    "This appears to be normal console behaviour, but I\u0027ll let them comment.\n\nPW\n",
    "Normal console behavior should be to display the reason why a build terminated.  The problem may not lie with the Console view itself however.  It may be that no error message is being sent to the console.\n\nHere\u0027s a clue.  About 30 seconds after terminating, the MacOS X console logged the following message:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ant.ui 4 120 2007-01-17 12:03:19.435\n!MESSAGE Error logged from Ant UI: \n!STACK 0\njava.net.SocketTimeoutException: Accept timed out\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketAccept(Native Method)\n\tat java.net.PlainSocketImpl.accept(PlainSocketImpl.java:384)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.implAccept(ServerSocket.java:450)\n\tat java.net.ServerSocket.accept(ServerSocket.java:421)\n\tat org.eclipse.ant.internal.ui.launchConfigurations.RemoteAntBuildListener$ServerConnection.run(RemoteAntBuildListener.java:95)\n\nSo I\u0027m guessing Ant is disconnecting before logging the error to the Eclipse console.  Any ideas?",
    "Moving to Ant - appears to be an Ant issue rather than debug. Sorry for the delay in triage.",
    "Robert, if you specify to run your builds within the same JRE as Eclipse (via the JRE tab of the Ant launch configuration) is there any problems?\n\nIs there a possibility that you (your computer) is blocking the socket communication?"
