    "I am using Eclipse 3.01 as the PDE for an IBM product based upon RAD. For some \nreason, sometimes the bundles do not all activate properly. I had this problem \nseveral weeks ago, and a switched the target JVM from the version shipped with \nWebSphere Application Server 6.0 (an IBM 1.42) to the JVM which originates from \nRAD (also an IBM 1.42, though a slightly different one), and the problem \nstopped. Then it started again yesterday, but I really cannot isolate the \nchange that did it. I believe that the change I made was to add a dependency to \na plugin other than the one mentioned below, but why that would cause a variety \nof unrelated plugins not to activate does not make much sense to me. \n\nI ran across the runtime spy and installed that in my target workbench. I can \nsee the plugins in the manifest view which are not being initialized, and I do \nnot see them in the activated pugin view. \n\nThis is the log entry that I currently get consistently. Again, the bundle \nwhere the class that cannot be found resides loaded consistently for some time. \nThen after altering another bundle from the PDE and relaunching, this class \ncould no longer be found. \n\n!SESSION Feb 23, 2005 08:31:31.569 ---------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dunknown\njava.fullversion\u003dJ2RE 1.4.2 IBM J9 2.2 Windows XP x86-32 j9n142ifx-20041102 \n(JIT enabled)\nJ9VM - 20040916_0908_lHdSMR\nJIT  - r7_level20040915_1801\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nCommand-line arguments: -product com.ibm.wbit.feature.ide -pdelaunch\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 1 Feb 23, 2005 08:31:31.569\n!MESSAGE Executable extension definition for \"class\" not found.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Feb 23, 2005 08:31:34.853\n!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-\nin: \"org.eclipse.core.runtime\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: \ncom.ibm.wbiserver.relationship.impl.RelationshipPackageImpl\n\tat com.ibm.wbit.config.builder.ConfigBuilder.\u003cinit\u003e\n(ConfigBuilder.java:88)\n\tat java.lang.Class.newInstanceImpl(Native Method)\n\tat java.lang.Class.newInstance(Class.java:1481)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.registry.ConfigurationElement.createExecutableExtensio\nn(ConfigurationElement.java:141)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.registry.ConfigurationElement.createExecutableExtensio\nn(ConfigurationElement.java:124)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.core.internal.registry.ConfigurationElement.createExecutableExtensio\nn(ConfigurationElement.java:113)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.instantiateBuilder\n(BuildManager.java:690)\n\tat",

    "Please make sure you pass -clean when launching a runtime workbench after you\nmake changes (add/remove plug-ins, change plug-in manifests, add/rename\npackages). Let us know if that helps.\n",

On the debug options list on the right, make sure\nyou check the \"debug\" debug option.",
    "I added a button to the workbench so I could force my bundle to load more \ndirectly, and it is loading fine. The problem must be in one of the plugins \nthat I am depending upon to invoke my code. I am still baffled by the fact that \nit was working, and then stopped, but I am not too concerned with that at this \npoint since I have bypassed enough code to get mine working. \n\nThanks for helping me out.
