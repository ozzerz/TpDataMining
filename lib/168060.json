    "It happens when I run such code.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot reproduce such erro outside the Eclipse even though inside the Eclipse but in other workspace. I mean: (1) when I run it outside the Eclipse it works properly; (2) when I run it inside the Eclipse, but in a different workspace, it works properly; (3) when I run it inside the Eclipse, in my usual workspace, it craches the OS.\n\nThe expected output of such code which can be seen in the standard IO for (1) and (2) is:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException\n\tat Testador.main(Testador.java:16)\n\n",
