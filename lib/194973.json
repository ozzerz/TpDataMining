    "We\u0027ve got the same issue since we upgraded JIRA from 3.7 to 3.10. There are a number of observations:\n\n1) When hitting \u0027validate server settings\u0027 in the JIRA configuration one now gets a Mylyn only supports JIRA version above 3.3 error message. Fortunately you can still okay this and use the connector\n\n2) Custom fields are the main stay of JIRA so any JIRA-Mylyn integration is going to have to handle these. We used to have plenty of custom fields on our 3.7 JIRA instance that Mylyn was happy with so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s directly related to this (could easily be wrong mind;).\n\nWe JAD\u0027ed some of the connector code and ran a packet sniffer on the dialogue between eclipse and JIRA. Observations from this include:\n\nErrors raised - one gets a NPE and a dataformaterror. the NPE is, i expect, from a corrupt JIRA issue object in the connector\u0027s model as it was coming from a simple issue.getCreateDate() and I would guess that came about from some other previous failing, sorry I don\u0027t have the NPE line at hand.\n\nOne is able to comment an issue once using mylyn successfully and perform a synchronise but if one tries again we got a dateformaterror. All further syncs hit this error.\n\nSniffing the edit post call you make to update the JIRA ticket shows that JIRA is coming back with an on screen error (actually JIRA represents the edit screen with a red box at the top, this is the type of box JIRA usually uses to \u0027inline highlight\u0027 which field is in error). The error box says that a required field has not been populated (or something like that) and quotes a custom field but I\u0027m not really sure it is, and if it is, its not an on screen one (and mylyn used to work fine before we upgrdaded to JIRA 3.10 and we\u0027ve not added any of our own new fields in that time).\n\nThe main change we can see with our new JIRA 3.10 is the \u0027Edit your comment\u0027 and \u0027Edit your worklogs\u0027 stuff, and with that JIRA is now maintaining more data about a comment (date etc).\n\nI have assigned a developer to investigate this in house (Fujitsu Services) but we would be doing this by sniffing and trying to reverse engineer the connector so obviously someone who knows the design in the first place is going to be much better placed to sort it out.\n\nSorry i havent got more concrete info bar, it used to work with JIRA 3.7 and now with JIAR 3.10.1 it doesn\u0027t but I\u0027ve got egg on my face at the mo\u0027 i have sold mylyn big time into our development communities and have had to withdraw it.\n\n",
