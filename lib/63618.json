    "The eclipse update site http://download.eclipse.org/updates should be \navailable out of the box when I search for new features to install.\n\nThis will open the door to make other add-on components easily available from \nthere for new users.",
    "The url provided by Erich (http://download.eclipse.org/updates) is redirected \nto http://update.eclipse.org/updates, which is already used as the update url.\n\nJim, I don\u0027t have access to the feature projects, but what is needed, is for \nevery eclipse feature (particularly for sdk,platform,jdt,pde) to add the \ndiscovery url, next to the update url:\n\n   \u003curl\u003e\n      \u003cupdate url\u003d\"http://update.eclipse.org/updates\" \n              label\u003d\"%updateSiteName\" /\u003e\n      \u003cdiscovery url\u003d\"http://update.eclipse.org/updates\" \n                 label\u003d\"%updateSiteName\" /\u003e\n   \u003c/url\u003e\n\nNow, that update site (http://download.eclipse.org/updates) contains all the \ndrivers since 2.0) so it is not very useful for 3.0. \nThe recommended way is for each major release to have its own update site, \nespecially as the update manager cannot update from 2.x to 3.x.\nSo, if not much trouble, we could change the above url\u0027s to be\nhttp://update.eclipse.org/update/3.0/ instead. That would make the look up \nfaster, and will show less clutter in the results page in the install wizard.\n\nThoughts ?\n",

    "[I am a new user to eclipse.

[eclipse can still internally switch to \"update.eclipse.org/update\"\nor \"update.eclipse.org/update3.0\" etc.! but a user can only enter \"eclipse.org\"]\n\nAll main eclipse features, which are described on eclipse.org should be\nreachable from the \"Search for new features to install\" Perspective (GEF, SWT,\nEMF, CDP, ...), thus a user can quickly select an download the basic\ninstallation he wants.\n\n-\n\nPlease review this 2 messages / threads on the newsgroup.\n\nRemember, this is what i got after download and install - an immediate\ndisappointment about the automatisms provided by eclipse. The \"serverity\" of\nsuch intro/update-related bugs should be \"major\" [personally, I would define\nthem as \"blocker\", cause they can \u0027block\u0027 people to use eclipse!]\n\nnews://news.eclipse.org/c967do$crt$1@eclipse.org\n\nnews://news.eclipse.org/c9601g$543$1@eclipse.org\n\n-\n\nHope you can gain some value out of my writings.\n",
