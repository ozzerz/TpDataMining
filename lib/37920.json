    "I have created my own view and resource type which will be IAdaptables. Once my \ntreeview has come up and the resource created. I have delete action to remove \nthe resource.

    "Note that IResource.PROJECT is not a valid flag for the delete method.  Look at\nthe API for IResource.delete to see what flags are valid.\n\nDeletion can fail for various reasons.  We cannot diagnose the reason because\nthe java.io deletion native just returns a boolean result.  Here are some\npossible reasons why delete may fail:\n\n- Disk is not accessible\n- You don\u0027t have the appropriate permission in the file system\n- Another application currently has an open file handle in that directory\n- An eclipse plugin has changed the working directory of the current VM to a\ndirectory inside where the deletion is taking place.\n\nYou\u0027ll have to investigate further at your end before we can help any further. \nFor example, see what files are failing to delete, and look at what plugins may\nhave recently operated on those files.  If individual files are failing to\ndelete, you can try IFile.getLocation().toFile().delete() to see if that\nsucceeds.  Let us know what you discover.",
    "I want to delete the project and I changed my delete with the following\nboolean bDeleteContents \u003d true;\nproj.delete(bDeleteContents,true,null); \nNow also I got the same exception as I mentioned earlier. \nThe resource is not used by anyone and also it is in my own system so no one \nelse is shared that resource or accessed. I have complete rights to modify any \nof the resource. Also I have plenty of working space. My disk has one C drive \nwith 40GB and 20 GB free space. However, I could not understand the following\n\n\"An eclipse plugin has changed the working directory of the current VM to a\ndirectory inside where the deletion is taking place.\". \n\nHow can I verify this?  \n\nWhen attempting to delete the project it deletes all the files and folders if \nany exist except the project directoy. So it is not rights or free space \nproblem. I hope this will be helpful. So the above snippet for delete is \nworking but it fails to remove only the project directory.\n\n \n ",
    "I found something but I am not sure that will be the reason or not. When I \ncreate the project on eclipse2.0 it creates a file called .project for that.\nWhen I call delete I think it fails to delete the .project file  so the delete \nwill return the exception. How can I force the delete to delete .project file \nalso?  ",
    "I tried the eclipse build version 2.0.3 with build id : 200303031653.\nIt also throws the same exception when I try to delete the project.",
    "On further debugging the delete operation I got the follwing exception message \nin the log file(it is happening rarely)\n\"Errors occurred while refreshing resources with the local filesystem.\"\n\n",
    "Is it only the .project file that fails to delete?  Look in the file system\nafter the delete fails and see what files are there.\n\nIn 2.0, when move failed, the destination was sometimes left out of sync with\nthe file system.  This means what you see in Eclipse may not reflect what has\nhappened on disk.\n\nIs it reproducible with different VMs?  You might want to try IBM JRE, J9SC, and\na Sun JRE to see if it happens in all cases. Another question: is it\nreproducible on another machine?  It could possibly be a hardware or disk problem.",
    "It is .project file and project folder fails during the project delete \noperation. \nI am using the JVM shipped with WSADIE5.0 with the build mentioned earlier.\nAlso I tried with sun JRE VM (j2re1.4.1_02) which gives the same result.\n\nIt is reproducible more systems. When we start the WSAD and switch my \nperspective and in my view I am creating the project,folder and file objects \nwhich are my own resource type satisfying WSAd requirement. I have no problem \nin deleting the folders and files but when I try to delete the project as soon \nas it is created and shown in my tree view. I tried to remove the newly created \nproject it removes all the folders and files in it. Only, the project folder \nand .project file are not removed from my workspace(physically).   ",

    "Also, do you have the same problems when you try and delete the project from \nanother view like the Navigator or Packages view?",
    "I don\u0027t have the problem in deleting the project from Eclipse\u0027s views like \nNavigator and Package View.  When we create our own view and resource types \nthen it happens. I am using only Plugin development and Resource perspective \nfor most of my work. So I am not sure this will be the problem in other \nperspective or not. But I don\u0027t have any problem in both Resource and plugin \ndevelopment perspective.  I tried to use java.io.File delete method directly \nthen it deletes the project (sometimes)  but it recreates the project when \nanother project creation takes place in Eclipse.  My code is working very good \nin eclipse1.0 version. You can give a suggestion which build of eclipse will be \nstable by stating the buildnumber date and eclipse version.  I gave already \nwhat version of eclipse I am using. That build is not good. Since the problem \nis encountered by all of our system with that build.\n\nStep to recreate the problem:\nCreate your own Treeview.\nCreate your own resource types for project folder and file which are \nIAdaptables.\nCreate the wizards for project creation.\nCreate actions for project creation and deletion.\nInclude the actions in the tree context menu of your own view(which is created \nearlier).\nCreate the project in the view.\nDelete the project in the view.",
    "Closing since the problem seems to be in the user\u0027s code and not in the plug-\nins which are distributed with the Eclipse SDK based on:\n- project deletion works ok in Navigator\n- project deletion works ok in Packages View\n- project deletion only fails in user created view\n- log file contains entries for Rational/IBM plug-ins but no Eclipse plug-ins"
