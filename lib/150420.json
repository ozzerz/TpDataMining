    "What are you trying to use the reporting facilities for? These have been mostly used for analyzing statistics from studies run with Mylar (in a runtime workbench setting). It would be useful to gather requirements as the reporting facilities are going to need an overhaul.",
    "Nothing, I was trying to run AllTests.",
    "Perhaps reports should move to sandbox?\n\n",
    "Fixed during the grand refactoring, this bug was the result of one of the preference monitors having moved.\n\nRegarding monitor.reports, it hasn\u0027t been moved to the Sandbox yet because monitor.tests depends on it and monitor.tests validates the correct behavior of the monitor.  I\u0027ve avoided creating a \"Sandbox\" component in Bugzilla becaues it is not very meaningful to users.  However, if we ever end up having a release update site with accessible Sandbox components we might need to add it.",
    "Fixed a while ago."
