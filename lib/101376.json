    "I\u0027m using I20050622 build.\nTo repro:\n1.  Create a new Generic WebLogic 9.0 server runtime (I have a version of 9.0 on\nmy machine) (Note, I used the \u0027Default JRE\u0027 which for me is 1.5.0_01)\n2.  In servers window, right click and select New\n3.  Create a new Generic WebLogic 9.0 server\n4.  Press the little green arrow to start the server\n\nNOTE:  if in step 1 I actually select jre1.5.0_01 instead of using \u0027default\u0027\nthis bug doesn\u0027t repro even though the default is the same as jre1.5.0_01\nResults:\nAn error appears stating that an internal error occurred trying to start the\nserver.  In the log file is the following:\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 2005-06-22 14:57:31.653\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Starting server\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jst.server.generic.core.internal.GenericServerBehaviour.setupLaunch(GenericServerBehaviour.java:376)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jst.server.generic.core.internal.ExternalLaunchConfigurationDelegate.launch(ExternalLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java:99)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:590)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:515)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:152)\n\tat org.eclipse.wst.server.core.internal.Server.start(Server.java:959)\n\tat org.eclipse.wst.server.core.internal.Server.synchronousStart(Server.java:1275)\n\tat org.eclipse.wst.server.ui.internal.StartServerJob.run(StartServerJob.java:43)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:76)",
    "Looks like some of the generic server code has changed since the last time I\ntested things w/ WLS 9.0 - I\u0027ll look into things now...",
    "hmmm, I\u0027m unable reproduce it using the latest from HEAD (I\u0027ve tried it using\nthe default JRE, both 1.4.2 and 1.5.0, as an explicitly assigned JRE)\n\nGorkem: looks like the NPE is being generated on the call to retrieve the\nServerPorts (which is odd) - also odd that this is tied to the selection of the\nJRE for the server runtime (could an error processing the JRE for the runtime\nfor some reason cause problem in serverdef file processing?)\n\n",
    "You know, as I try again, it isn\u0027t tied to JRE selection.  It just repros either\nway.  Sorry about that.",
    "FYI: I tried a few other permutations but have been unable to reproduce this bug:\n-used just the 6/22 I-build (and dependent components) and that I-build plus the\ngeneric server plugins built from the latest CVS source (note: there are a few\ndiffs between the I-build and the latest in CVS).\n-launched the test Eclipse instance with various JREs: 1.5 (Sun and JRockit) and\n1.4.2\n",
    "The problem may be getting masked by the following code in Server (if tracing is\nnot enabled for Server, you just get a null ServerPort[] and then NPE I think we\nare seeing):\n\npublic ServerPort[] getServerPorts(IProgressMonitor monitor) {\n\t\ttry {\n\t\t\treturn getDelegate(monitor).getServerPorts();\n\t\t} catch (Exception e) {\n\t\t\tTrace.trace(Trace.SEVERE, \"Error calling delegate getServerPorts() \" +\ntoString(), e);\n\t\t\treturn null;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nJill: assuming tracing has not already been turned on for\norg.eclipse.wst.server.core, see if anything new appears in the log when you\nrepeat the scenario with tracing enabled.",
    "I do not have a WLS 9 but I could not repro with wls8.1 also. Is your eclipse\nrunning on a JRE 1.5? Also can you enable trace as Rob described?",
    "Probably unrelated, but here\u0027s another thought about what might be causing this:\nI believe the version of EMF used with the WTP I-builds changed recently (now\nemf-sdo-xsd-SDK-I200506160200.zip) and perhaps if you still had the old version\nthat could cause in an error processing the serverdef XML file since the generic\nserver framework uses EMF to perform XML data binding on these files.",
    "OK, I did some more research and I had an old version of Java 1.5 JRE (like b08\ninstead of b64).  So I updated that to the latest, and guess what.  Things seem\nto work.  At least I don\u0027t get that NPE I was seeing before.\n\nNot sure if it makes sense that an older version of Java1.5 would cause this\ncrash, but it appears that it was.\n\nThanks,\nJill\n\n",

    "After upgrading JDK, no longer having this issue.  Thanks.",
