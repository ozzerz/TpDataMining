    "I have tried both a TPTP JUnit test and a TPTP URL test with the TPTP-4.2.0-200603050100 build of TPTP and got the same error message and the run wouldn\u0027t launch. I notice that the java process (probably for the session) briefly appears and then goes away. I tried with the firewall turned off. I started the RAC with an access of \u0027LOCAL\u0027.\n\nHere\u0027s the error message\n\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: IWAT4039E The Test Execution Harness reported the following problems:java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connectorg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.core.file.ServerNotAvailableException: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused: connect\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.test.core.launch.delegates.AbstractLaunchConfigurationDelegate2.launch(AbstractLaunchConfigurationDelegate2.java:178)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:639)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.core.LaunchConfiguration.launch(LaunchConfiguration.java:565)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin.buildAndLaunch(DebugUIPlugin.java:753)\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.DebugUIPlugin$6.run(DebugUIPlugin.java:943)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)",
    "The last TPTPDC that seems to work is TPTP-4.2.0-200602270100. I am able to launch a test against an agen controller from that build using the driver from TPTP-4.2.0-200603050100 but not against the agent from the same build.\n",
