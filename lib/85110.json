    "When attempting to start the standalone help on an IBM eServer p5 550 w/ SLES\n9.0, I get the following message (also occurs on SLES 9/IA-64):\n\njava.lang.Exception: Unknown exception.\n        at org.eclipse.help.internal.standalone.Eclipse.run(Eclipse.java:121) \n\nThis command was used:\n\njava -classpath\n/home/droy/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.help.base_3.0.1/helpbase.jar\norg.eclipse.help.standalone.Infocenter -clean -noexec -command start\n-eclipsehome /home/droy -port 8082\n\nI tested with the minimal plugins list found at\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/help_infocenter.html?rev\u003d1.27.2.2\n\n\nTo reproduce, unzip any 3.0.1 or 3.1Mx build (Linux, Win32, doesn\u0027t matter, I\ntried a dozen) on a SLES 9/PPC or SLES 9/IA-64, remove plugins as described in\nthe link above and run the command above as a non-privileged (or root) user.\n\n\njava version \"1.4.2\"\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2)\nClassic VM (build 1.4.2, J2RE 1.4.2 IBM build cxp641420-20040626 (JIT enabled:\njitc)) \n\nI can supply an ssh shell to any Eclipse committer who needs access to SLES 9 on\nPPC or SLES 9 on IA-64.\n\nDenis",
    "You use the term \"standalone\" help, and yet the startup command you cite is for \nthe Information Center mode (because you have \"Infocenter\" in the startup \ncommand you cite). Which one are you really intending to start up?\n\n-eclipsehome should be the Eclipse installation directory, where Eclipse is \ninstalled, and it should be the parent to \"plugins\" directory (as stated at \nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv\n/reference/misc/help_infocenter.html?rev\u003d1.27.2.2). Given the command you say \nyou are using, shouldn\u0027t -eclipsehome be /home/droy/eclipse and not \nsimply /home/droy?\n\n--Lee Anne\n\n\n\n\n",
    "FYI.  I have opened and fixed bug 84943, few days ago for help reporting \nException(\"Unknown exception\"), where there was known real one.",
    "Thanks Konrad for that.\n\n--Lee Anne",
    "Denis,\nHas Lee Anne\u0027s comment 1 solved the issue?",
    "(In reply to comment #4)\n\u003e Denis,\n\u003e Has Lee Anne\u0027s comment 1 solved the issue?\n\nThanks, I discovered this shortly before actually reading this comment.  My\nmistake for misinterpreting the -eclipsehome parameter.  I believed it served\nthe only purpose of storing the workspace, .metadata and .lock.  My intention\nwas to separate the application (which I wanted read-only by my web service\nuser) from the written data, but this doesn\u0027t seem possible.\n\nThanks for your time in helping me get this running.\n\nDenis",
    "I will resolve the bug as invalid.  Good eyes Lee Anne.  Thank you.\n\nDenis,\nIn addition to -eclipseHome, you can use -data and -configuration.  With the \nlatter two pointing to writable area, the first one (and eclipse) can be at \nread only location."
