    "Note that after the error I have to restart the workbench to recover.\nThis seems to be a regression from 4.4.0 as it was found running an\nexisting test case that requires reconfiguring and restart AC.",
    "I also see this in the situation where my workbench is on XP and\nthe ACServer is on EM64T (W2K3)",

    "Hi Igor. The patch looks good. Just one question... should the \"IAgentController\" interface be changed? If someone has already implemented that interface then it will be broken by this patch.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d75107)\nupdated patch\n\nHi Samson,\nI thought this interface is not intended to be implemented by users.\nBut if you concern and think it is important, please review the updated patch.\nThanks.",
    "Hi Igor. I prefer the updated patch better since it does not change the interfaces. Please go ahead to request for approval after you have finished your testing. Thanks.\n",
    "Hi Samson.\nCould you please check the patch in?\nThanks.",
    "Patch checked into both 4.4.0.2 and HEAD. Igor, please mark this as fixed. Thanks.\n",
    "Patch committed"
