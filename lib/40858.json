    "\"super.{pointcut}(..)\" causes the weaver to throw an exception:\n\norg.aspectj.weaver.BCException: Bad type signature: \u003cmissing\u003e\nat org.aspectj.weaver.TypeX.signatureToName(TypeX.java:565)\nat org.aspectj.weaver.TypeX.getName(TypeX.java:205)\n...\n\nThe \"super\" is unnecessary since the pointcut is implicitly qualified by the\nenclosing type, so it can be removed to avoid the stack trace.\n\nFind test case in modules/tests/bugs/SuperPointcutCE.java",
    "Sorry, workaround of removing \"super\" is wrong in cases where the pointcut is\nbeing redefined in the current aspect.  In this case, the workaround is to\nspecify the super-type instead:\n  from: super.pc()\n    to: AA.pc()\n where: AA is the relevant supertype",
    "super is not allowed in pointcut definitions in AspectJ-1.0 or 1.1.  It seems\nlike a reasonable thing to ask for in 1.2.\n\nHowever, having a stack trace for any unknown type name in this position is\nterrible and easily fixed.  This is now fixed in the tree for 1.1.1.\n\n(Note: This bug will be actually marked fixed (and P2) when I get my eclipse\naccount to work with my new email)",
