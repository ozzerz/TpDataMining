    "Hi!\n\nEclipse: 3.0 RC2 \nBuild id: 200406111814\nSynchronization: \norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSException: Synchronization bytes are\nmissing for parent of resource \u0027a_resource\u0027 in synchronization partner\n\u0027org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.syncinfo.CVSBaseResourceVariantTree\u0027 on get.\n        \nat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.syncinfo.CVSResourceVariantTree.getResource\nVariant(CVSResourceVariantTree.java:133)\n        at\norg.eclipse.team.core.variants.ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.getSyncInfo(Resour\nceVariantTreeSubscriber.java:53)\n        at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSSyncTreeSubscriber.getSyncInfo(CVSSyncTr\neeSubscriber.java:77)\n        at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.core.subscribers.SubscriberEventHandler.collect(Subsc\nriberEventHandler.java:247)\n        at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.core.subscribers.SubscriberEventHandler.processEvent(\nSubscriberEventHandler.java:401)\n        at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.core.BackgroundEventHandler.processEvents(BackgroundE\nventHandler.java:283)\n        at\norg.eclipse.team.internal.core.BackgroundEventHandler$1.run(BackgroundEventHand\nler.java:140)\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:66)\n\nI\u0027ve found a related bug Bug#42792 but it says there that is fixed.",
    "I thought it was but appearently it is not. Could you tell us what you were \ndoing when the exception was logged? Is this reproducable for you? I suspect \nthat the problem is that one thread is accessing the sync info while another \nis clearing it which would mean that there would be no adverse side effects. \nWas there any noticable side effects?",
    "You are very right about side-effects: there were not side effects.\nThe exception occured during a normal synchronization. I will try tomorrow to\nreproduct it and give you a more suitable bug scenario.",
    "Sorry (or happy - i am not quite sure) I cannot reproduce it.\n\nDigging into my memory the exception occured during the following operations:\n- the project was already checked out\n- the project was a little modified in Eclipse 3.0 RC1\n- the project was created in Eclipse 3.0 RC2\n- the project was synchronized",
    "I\u0027m closing then,"
