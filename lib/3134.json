    "MA (02.10.2001 11:21:41)\n\tCouldn\u0027t the error messages / stack traces coming from failed plugin loading be a bit more helpful?\n\tThe most common stack trace is \u0027application not found\u0027. and stands for all kind of problems, xml parsing error,\n\trequired plugins of the application class not found, -dev bin not set...\n\n\tYou need to enable the debug traces, to have a chance to see the problem. \n\n\tWhen \u0027org.eclipse.core.runtime\u0027 is not existing, the stacktrace is\n\t\tjava.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException: java.lang.NullPointerException\n\t\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.activateDefaultPlugins(InternalPlatform.java:100)\n\t\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.loaderStartup(InternalPlatform.java:530)\n\n\tDebugging the plugin classloader is a really painful experience.\n\n\nNOTES:\n\nJohnA (10/5/2001 12:40:17 PM)\n\tA couple of examples of bad (or misleading) error reporting:\n\t\t- create two plugins with circular dependency --\u003e no error message at all, plugins aren\u0027t loaded\n\t\t- runtime exception in Plugin class constructor or startup() method, gets reported as a \n\t\t\tNoClassDefFoundError on the class that triggered the plugin activation.",

    "For build 20020312.\n\n\nPlugin related error messages are improving.  Now, plugin parsing and resolving \nshould give meaningful error messages in most error conditions.\n\nNext areas to work on are plugin activation and creation of executable \nextensions (see comments from Jeff McAffer).\n\n",

    "Rafael did a pass on many of the error messages and we are continuously \nimproving any additional ones as we see them.  Closing."
