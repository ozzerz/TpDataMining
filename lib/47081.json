    "The problem was that Chris entered the wrong repository path. In this case, he \nshould have recieved an error message stating this. For extssh, the connection \nvalidation in the New Location dialog only validates the connection info (the \nproper error message is displayed for pserver). Also, the exception in the log \nis misleading, tus masking the true problem (which was also in the log as a \nsingle line).",
    "Downgrading severity (Chris, if you feel that it is more severe, please \nadjust).",
    "Post 3.0",
    "Code was added in 3.1 to show the error"
