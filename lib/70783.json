    "Hi, \n\nOn Eclipse 3.0 with AJDT 1.1.11, I have been unable to install XMLBuddy 2.0.10.\nEclipse would simply ignore it.\n\nAfter having disabled AJDT with Eclipse Configuration Manager (casually ...),\nXMLBuddy magically appeared !\n\nI don\u0027t know if its a bug of Eclipse, XMLBuddy or AJDT, but I thought it was\nright to signal it here.\n\nBob Foster (XMLBuddy) suggested:\n\n\u003e I believe what you did signalled Eclipse \n\u003e to check for configuration changes.\n\u003e On some platforms (what\u0027s yours?) \n\u003e Eclipse doesn\u0027t notice plugins dropped\n\u003e into the plugins folder. You would have \n\u003e gotten the same effect (XMLBuddy \n\u003e appeared) by deleting the configuration folder.\n\n\nversions\nEclipse 3.0 final\nEclipse AspectJ Development Tools 1.1.11\nXMLBuddy 2.0.10\nrunning on win2K + JDK 1.4.2_05",
    "See the README.\nYou\u0027re likely running on FAT32 in which case you need to restart with -clean \nto detect changes.",
    "That is correct, I am running on FAT32. \nI understand I should have read the README. \nThe problem might be given more visibility (in the user interface for example,\nin the configuration manager).",
    "Dorian,\n\nI think this problem is much bigger than just XMLBuddy and FAT32.\nI\u0027ve run into problems updating several product extensions running on Windows XP\nand an NTFS file system.  Any time I update, the next Eclipse restart will throw\nseveral exceptions about the contributed actions, editors, or views not being\navailable.  In addition, the \u0027About Eclipse...\u0027 dialog will show the features,\nbut the providers are blank and the features are obviously misconfigured. \nHowever, once eclipse is manually restarted with -clean, all is well.\n\nCould -clean be made the default option for a restart after reconfiguring the\nplatform after an update?  It would surely solve a lot of problems and make the\nupdate mechanism perform accurately in all cases.\n\nI\u0027d also suggest changing the short description of this bug to be more\ndescriptive of the full scope of this issue.",
    "Todd, this looks like the Platform Runtime bug 70176. Basically, plugins with \na manifest.mf that got there during zip/jar is interpreted by the runtime as a \nbundle manifest, so the plugin.xml is not looked at.\nPlease confirm if this is the case. Thanks!",
    "Dorian,\n\nThanks for the followup and quick reply.  Bug #70176 sounds like the problem\nbecause all the jars were created with the jar command and as a result *do* have\na MANIFEST.MF file by default.  However, they are not OSGI bundles at all. \nNaturally, this is a rather widespread problem since most update jars won\u0027t be\nOSGI bundles at the present time. :-)  I\u0027m glad to see that this is indeed\nresolved by the 3.0.1 target as it makes all updates look *broken* from the end\nuser perspective.",
    "Dorian,\nOne more bit of information.  I rebuild a local update site with jars\nspecifically created with the -M jar option so that no manifest files would be\ncreated.  However, after update the problems seemed even worse as only two of\nthe five features were event detected.  As before, restarting with -clean\ncorrected the installation.  So, I\u0027m going to go back to requesting strongly\nthat this be the default behavior for workbench restarts after updates.",
    "Todd, I think the orgininal bug description and problem is different than what \nyou\u0027re seeing. Could you please describe the steps to reproduce what you \ndescribe in comment #6 ?",
    "Here are the steps to reproduce the problem.\n\n1) Install a clean version of Eclipse 3.0\n2) Download the MyEclipse 3.8.0 manual installation available here:\nhttp://www.myeclipseide.com/products/eworkbench/eclipse-bug70783-test/myeclipse_030800.zip\n3) Unzip the archive somewhere outside your Eclipse installation. \n4) Install it as a product extension through Help \u003e Manage Configuration...\n5) Restart\n6) Open Help \u003e About Eclipse and notice the five MyEclipse features are installed.\n7) Open the MyEclipse Perspective and the Error Log view\n8) Exit the workbench\n9) Update to version 3.8.1 by adding a new update site that points to:\nhttp://www.myeclipseide.com/products/eworkbench/updates-3.8.0to3.8.1\n10) Allow the workbench to restart\n11) Upon restart you\u0027ll get several errors about missing action sets and the\nneed to reset the perspective.\n12) The log will have several errors in it about missing functionality and most\nof the features are now unavailable even though 3.8.1 was only a bug-fix update.\n13) Clear the log file in the Error Log view and exit Eclipse\n14) Restart with the -clean option and notice that now MyEclipse 3.8.1 starts\nwithout error and all functionality is now available.\n\nNaturally, the lare number of errors in the log and multiple perspective reset\ndialogs do not enhance the end user experience.  The broken functionality after\nthe update only exacerbates the issue.  Again, all fixed with a -clean start. \nHope that helps.  Please let me know if you need any more information.\n\n",
    "Todd, I\u0027d suggest you open a bug against Platform UI and describe your \nproblem. The update to 3.8.1 worked fine, all the dialogs are put up by the \nworkbench. There may be some problem in the way the update is packaged, as I \ncould see some osgi error.\n\n\nFor reference, here is the log file that I get:\n\n!SESSION Aug 25, 2004 20:18:15.463 --------------------------------------------\n-\neclipse.buildId\u003dI200406240800\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_03\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\n\n!ENTRY System Bundle 0 0 Aug 25, 2004 20:18:15.463\n!MESSAGE FrameworkEvent.ERROR\n!STACK 0\norg.osgi.framework.BundleException: PackageAdmin.refreshPackages failed to \ncomplete\n\tat \norg.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl.processDelta\n(PackageAdminImpl.java:518)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl.refreshPackages\n(PackageAdminImpl.java:352)\n\tat org.eclipse.osgi.framework.internal.core.PackageAdminImpl$1.run\n(PackageAdminImpl.java:321)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\nCaused by: org.osgi.framework.BundleException: Internal Error in the OSGi \nframework.
