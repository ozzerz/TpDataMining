    "I get the following messages in my .log file 100\u0027s of times when I startup \nEclipse 3.0M7 (the log file has over 5000 lines).  I have all of Eclipse loaded \nas \"external plugins\" and all of CDT loaded as normal plugin projects.  \nMy .project, etc files are readonly, since I\u0027m getting them from our perforce \nserver, but I don\u0027t think that should be an error on startup.  Most of the \ntrace is in JDT, but PDE was also involved so I submitted against PDE.  I will \nattach the full log.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Feb 24, 2004 18:16:07.556\n!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: \"org.eclipse.core.ru\nntime\".\n!STACK 1\nJava Model Exception: Core Exception [code 279] File /org.eclipse.cdt.core/.proj\nect is read-only.\n        at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.SetClasspathOperation.updateProjectRefe\nrencesIfNecessary(SetClasspathOperation.java:813)\n        at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.SetClasspathOperation.executeOperation(\nSetClasspathOperation.java:232)\n[snip long stack trace]\nCaused by: org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: File /org.ecli\npse.cdt.core/.project is read-only.\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.validateSave(Workspace.\njava:2121)\n[snip another long trace]\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.core 4 279 Feb 24, 2004 18:16:07.576\n!MESSAGE File /org.eclipse.cdt.core/.project is read-only.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.core 4 279 Feb 24, 2004 18:16:07.586\n!MESSAGE File /org.eclipse.cdt.core/.project is read-only.\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.core 4 4 Feb 24, 2004 18:16:07.606\n!MESSAGE Exception occurred in classpath container initializer: org.eclipse.jdt.\ninternal.launching.JREContainerInitializer@114a41\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.ResourceException: File /org.eclipse.cdt.cor\ne/.project is read-only.\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.validateSave(Workspace.\njava:2121)",

    "Moving to JDT-CORE for comment - not sure why the project would be read-only.",
    "Read-only-ness comes from perforce interaction. We are not allowed to modify \nany resources for these, thus JDT is failing to update project references when \nclasspath gets initialized.\n\nAren\u0027t you missing some perforce support so as to allow you to automatically \nallow to write files when conditions are met ? (Lazy automatic write rights \nbeing granted) ?\n\nIf not, then there is nothing we can do, as if we cannot fixup the build order, \nthen no reasonable build can occur. \n\nJohnA - shouldn\u0027t a change to project dynamic reference be allowed even for a \nread-only project ? Read-only here only applies to the filesystem, and not to \nthe metadata.\n\nMoving to platform for further comment.",
    "We did not have dynamic references in M7. The perforce plugin will probably need\nupdating for 3.0, but this particular problem should not occur in M9."
