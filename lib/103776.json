    "Hello,\n\nIf I use the Help-\u003eSoftware Updates-\u003eFind and Install... and try to install any \nnew plugin/update the download starts but then after a short time the network \nconnection freezes. A ping with option -t which I run parallel also stops \nwith \u0027exceeded timelimit\u0027. If I deactivate the network connection and activate \nit again the installation continues but after next few seconds the problem \noccurs again. So I can try to finish the installation by \ndeactivating/activating the network connection again and again.\nBut sometimes then an error message in a new window appears:\n\nProblem Occured\n\nUpdate operation has failed\n\nand I am only able to click OK and then the complete installation failed.\n\nAfter closing Eclipse, the network connection comes back.\n\nThis bug happens always on using the update manager so it is no occasional \nproblem. It happens also independently of the update filesize, so it doesn\u0027t \nmatter if the update is big or small.\nI have two network adaptors in my PC, one is an ADSL connection from German T-\nOnline the other one is a LAN connection to a proxy server which is connected \nto the internet by a 1 MBit SDSL line. On both the described problem occurs.\n\nI use WindowsXP Professional and\n\nEclipse Version: 3.1.0, Build id: I20050627-1435",
    "I forgot to mention that I use:\n\nJava version 1.5.0_04\nJava(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_04-b05)\nJava HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_04-b05, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n",
    "I\u0027d like to add that I have this problem as well.\n\nHas occurred with both Windows XP SP1, as well as SP2.  I have also used both\nthe JDK mentioned above, as well as the latest 1.4 JDK.  Happens in every\ncombination.\n\nI might also add that when this happens, I observe that the memory usage of the\njavaw process starts to climb until it is killed.  Once killed, the network\nconnection comes right back up.",

    "I\u0027m also seeing the same issue on Windows XP Professional with SP 2 installed. \nI have a Penium 4 1.70 GHz machine with 1 GB of RAM.  I have a US Robotics\nrouter, and during the \"verification\" of the jar files downloaded, even the\nconnection to the router gets lost.  (i.e. Pinging the local router times out.)\n As soon as I stop Eclipse, things are back to normal (connection works again!).\n\nI tried turning off the Windows firewall and shutting down the antivirus\nsoftware (avast) and Microsoft anti-spyware tool.  It didn\u0027t help at all.\n\nThis may be a more widespread issue than it initially seemed.\n",
