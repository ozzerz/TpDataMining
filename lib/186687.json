    "A plugin that includes a Xerces jar in its lib directory and classpath causes the EMF score editor to fail to open, with the dreaded:\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.xerces.jaxp.SAXParserFactoryImpl\n\tat javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory.newInstance(SAXParserFactory.java:107)\n\tat org.eclipse.emf.ecore.plugin.EcorePlugin.computePlatformPluginToPlatformResourceMap(EcorePlugin.java:303)\n...\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\nProject requires oaw..utils.stdlib.\nProject include xerces libs in classpath [xerces packages are *not* exported]\nProject plugin has been exported.\n\nWorkaround:\n\nRemove one of ...stdlib, the Xerces libs from stdlib plugin lib dir, or the jar.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nIn my case, the addition of the jar was neccessary because I needed to support standalone ant workflow execution for testing. Replacing both instances of the lib w/ latest [2.9] did _not_ solve the problem. But it turned out that I did not end up needing the stdlib dependency, and removing it fixed the issue. It is not clear wether the ultimate cause of this can be laid on oAW, EMF, my unneccessary dependencies, or my favorite, the \"fail-slow\" Xerces ;) implementation, but it is extremely difficult to diagnose.\n\nWould it be possible to remove the xerces dependency, or remove the jar from lib and make it reference whatever xerces plugin EMF is presumably using?",
    "Forgot to mention -- this happens with pluginbuilder 4.1.2.200705011442NGT.jar and 4.1.2 from update site and Eclipse 3.3M7 -- I noticed that M7 or M6 appear to have introduced direct dependencies on Jasper (JSP?) and I have read of conflicts there. ",
    "ok, most likely the problem is that oaw reexports the libs.\n\nAt the moment we are in the process of refactoring/removing the libs bundle. This should hopefully fix that issue.",
    "This bug should be fixed.\n\nCan you please double-check?\nThe first build which should work is\n4.1.2.200705130800NGT\n\nThanks\n\nBernd",
    "Yep! \n\nAs an aside, I had to do a bit of rearranging on my side as I manually grab eclipse plugins as jrs for ant builds. But it is much better to not have these exposed I think.",
