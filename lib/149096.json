    "When attempting to perform load time weaving of a concrete aspect defined in an aop.xml file, I get the following stack trace:\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoSuchFieldError: ajc$cflowCounter$0\n        at TestMain.main(TestMain.aj:8)\n\nThe concrete aspect extends an abstract aspect that defines a cflow pointcut.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d45512)\nTest case containing simple code that duplicates the bug\n\nAttaching simple source code that demonstrates the bug",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d45606)\nPatch to the junit test cases adding the test case for the bug\n\n",
    "I think this is the same as bug 132080.  It occurs because LTW concrete-aspect definitions are not exposed to the weaver.  If they aren\u0027t exposed, they don\u0027t get the necessary cflow field.  (there are no doubt a large family of errors in this area...)",
    "It makes sense that this would be the same bug as 132080, although I suspect that not supporting advising cflow pointcuts in concrete aspects is a more serious limitation for many users than other forms of not weaving concrete aspects.",
    "i agree",
    "Marking as duplicate give the solution, if it works, will be the same.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 132080 ***"
