    "Unfortunately, I can\u0027t narrow this bug down much further. It seems to be very\nsensitive to the exact set of aspect behaviours enlisted in the attachment.\nHowever, the symptoms are, when compiled under 1.2rc2 and run under\njrockit81sp2_141_05 (the latest version) I get the following output:\n\n30\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: aspectOf\n        at problem.Foo.getName()Ljava.lang.String;(Foo.java:???)\n        at problem.Foo.main([Ljava.lang.String;)V(Foo.java:14)\n\nThe code executes without error under AspectJ 1.1.1 + JRockit and also executes\ncorrectly on AspectJ 1.2rc2 + Sun\u0027s Java 1.4.2.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d10922)\nTest case as source\n\n(Sorry this got assigned to you Jim, I know how you feel about JRockit bugs!)\nThis test case reproduces the problem. Run Foo.main()--if it executes without\nerror, the problem is solved...",

    "This seems to be a problem in JRockit 81sp2, which has been fixed in 81sp3 (also\nknown as 1.4.2 just to confuse things). \n\nIt is available from BEA at:\nhttp://commerce.bea.com/showproduct.jsp?family\u003dWLJR\u0026major\u003dJR142SDK\u0026minor\u003d0\n\nOr, simpler, from download.com at:\nhttp://www.download.com/BEA-WebLogic-JRockit-SDK/3000-2417-10293837.html?tag\u003dlst-0-1",
    "Fantastic! thanks so much for taking the time to respond on this bug report. \nI\u0027ll close it now - Nick, please reopen if you still have problems.",
