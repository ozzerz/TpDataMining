    "With the fix for bug#144142 I am able to view the Synonyms in Derby DB. But this\nSynonym folder also appears under other/non-Derby Schemas too.",
    "This bug also affects other database connections due to buggy ContentProvider delegation.\n\nFor eg. Oracle plugin (with org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/ServerExplorerContentProvider extension) is loaded when a Oracle database connection is created. And when a Derby connection is created and when navigating down the schema, this bug causes the DSENavigator to call ServerExplorerContentProvider defined in Oracle plugin which in turn fails with following exception\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui.navigator 4 0 2006-07-05 16:18:00.227\n!MESSAGE Could not acquire children from extension: oracle.dbtools.connectivity.ui.explorer.providers.ServerExplorerContentProvider\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.eclipse.datatools.connectivity.internal.derby.catalog.DerbyCatalogSchema\n\tat oracle.dbtools.connectivity.ui.explorer.providers.ServerExplorerContentProvider.getChildren(ServerExplorerContentProvider.java:67)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.extensions.SafeDelegateTreeContentProvider.getChildren(SafeDelegateTreeContentProvider.java:91)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.extensions.SafeDelegateTreeContentProvider.getChildren(SafeDelegateTreeContentProvider.java:281)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.extensions.SafeDelegateTreeContentProvider.getChildren(SafeDelegateTreeContentProvider.java:89)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.internal.navigator.NavigatorContentServiceContentProvider.internalGetChildren(NavigatorContentServiceContentProvider.java:243)",
    "Anthos,\n\nI cannot reproduce this problem.  I\u0027m guessing there is either a problem with your extensions or with the way you\u0027re extending the framework (not to say it\u0027s easy to figure out what the right way is).  I have not been able to reproduce this one of our specialized implementations.  Could you please provide more information so I can investigate this further.\n\nAlso, after implementing a specialized catalog loader and content provider myself, I think there is definitely some work required to make the framework easier to use and extend.  Any comments you have regarding this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nAlso, given the time, I\u0027m moving the fix for this off to 0.9.1 RC0.\n\nThanks in advance,\nRob\n",

    "Rob, \n\nGiven that this is \"critical\" and the last comment says it is deferred to 1.5, what is the 1.5 target milestone for this?",
    "Hey John,\n\nThis defect is partially fixed.  However, a complete fix requires a modification to the Derby model.  Until that is changed, this cannot be completely fixed.  When the entry blocking this one is fixed, I can update the content extension and close this out.\n\nAt this time, it looks like 154167 is targeted for 1.5.  I have no other information beyond that.\n\nRob",
