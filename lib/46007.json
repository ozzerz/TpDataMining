    "build N20031031\n\n- org.eclipse.ui.workbench loaded from RCP_WORK_1 stream\n- org.eclipse.ui.activities folder\u0027s content has tag RCP_PRE_MERGE_20031103\n- Team \u003e Merge, choose v20031015 as the base version, and v20031028 as the \nversion to merge with\n- it computes the delta, flashes something in the sync view, then the sync view \nis cleared\n- in repo view, comparing v20031015 and v20031028 of this folder shows many \nchanges, including added, removed and changed files\n- back in sync view, change the comparison method to revision numbers\n- it shows the changes\n- open a few files\n- they have content changes, and not just whitespace changes\n\nI first encountered this when merging the whole project.  It was only later, \nafter I thought I had completed the merge, when I tried building and found \nthere were compile errors because the merge was not complete in this folder.",
    "After I got it to show the changes, I selected the folder and chose Update.\nIt gave me the conflicts prompt, and I chose to overwrite.\nIt only overwrote some of the files.\n\nTried again: \n- replaced with latest from branch RCP_WORK_1\n- then tried the merge again (needed to change filtering again for the changes \nto show)\n- this time, I selected the first file: ActivityManagerFactory.java and chose \nUpdate.  \n- it made no local changes (despite there being content changes) then the Sync \nview contents disappeared again.\n- switching comparison methods made the changes reappear\n\nTried again with another file: IActivity.java.  This time the changes were \napplied, but the sync view contents were still cleared.\n\n\n\n",

    "To work around this, I got it to load the additions and removals from the sync \nview, then did a replace with revision on each of the remaining files.\n",
    "Same problem in the folder for the org.eclipse.ui.roles package.\n\nRemoving all merges from the sync view and restarting did not fix the problem.\n",
    "Investigated and found the following bugs that caused this behavior:\n- the merge update command was treating all files as additions and not \nperforming the proper -j \u003cstart\u003e -j \u003cend\u003e cvs merge operation.\n- the setSyncInfo() was checking for parent bytes for folders, this was not \nnecessary and explains the .log message.\n- merging on a non-root project was broken because the content provider for \nthe sync view was filtering out non-project roots. \n\nAll have been fixed and I\u0027ll be adding tests for these cases soon. I will \nclose when the tests have been added.",
    "Tests have been released to HEAD. Old code failed the tests and new fixes \npass! Youppi!"
