    "Can I ask why this is targeted for  153?\n\nThis is expected in R2.0 because the component is being removed.\nThis view needs to be removed or contributed another way - but I don\u0027t see the issue in 153",
    "We\u0027d like to be sure RDB dependancies are removed (or, at least well\nunderstood) by 1.5.3. In order to make sure all is well for removing it \nin 2.0, I\u0027d like to understand the solution before 1.5.3 is finished, in case something must be done to provide an evolutionary solution. For example, if database providers do have to make a contribution to this perspective, then 1.5.3 is RDB\u0027s \"last chance\". \n\nDepending on what you propose as the solution, you may be right ... maybe no change in 1.5.3, which is why I say \"at least well understood\". Do you have a solution in mind? Or is it obvious, and I just don\u0027t see it? \n\n",
