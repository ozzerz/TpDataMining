    "Build ID: I20070806-1800\n\nWhile playing with the History View in order to make some progress on 188278, I bumped into a NPE. I tried to create a list of the exact steps I made, but I couldn\u0027t make it. IIRC I did some add/remove from version control on both files and folders. I got the NPE while fetching revision for one of .cvsignore files.\n\neclipse.buildId\u003dI20070806-1800\njava.version\u003d1.5.0_10\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003dpl_PL\nFramework arguments:  -product org.eclipse.sdk.ide -pdelaunch\nCommand-line arguments:  -product org.eclipse.sdk.ide -data C:\\workspace\\runtime-EclipseApplication -dev file:C:/workspace/eclipse/team/dev.eclipse.org_HEAD/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/Eclipse Application/dev.properties -pdelaunch -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86\n\nError\nWed Aug 08 11:17:36 CEST 2007\nAn internal error occurred during: \"Fetching CVS revision history\".\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.filehistory.CVSFileHistory.refresh(CVSFileHistory.java:106)\nat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSHistoryPage$RefreshCVSFileHistory.run(CVSHistoryPage.java:1319)\nat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)",
    "The \".cvsignore\" file, which caused the exception to be thrown, lied under a\nfolder which wasn\u0027t shared. At least this is how it looked in the Package\nExplorer. The strangest thing is that at the same time the corresponding\n\"Entries\" files contained an entry with that folder.",

    "It looks like it was previously stated that this was verified in I20070917-1300. The problem is that it is very unclear where to retrieve the download for this. Is it in the latest build of Eclipse 3.3? if so what build number?\n\nMy info is:\n\nEclipse Platorm\nVersion 3.3.0\nBuild ID: M20070921-1145",
    "The patch was released to HEAD so it won\u0027t be in the 3.3 Maintenance Stream. To download a distribution with the patch applied you will need to grab one the I- or N- builds made after 20070917-1300 (the I-build Szymon used should be enough). Please check Eclipse Project Downloads page[2].\n\n[1] http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/"
