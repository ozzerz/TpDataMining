    "3.0 M8\n\njava.lang.ClassCastException\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.views.navigator.ResourceNavigator.saveState\n(ResourceNavigator.java:996)\n\n\nI extended ResourceNavigator to provide a customized view for resource \nelements. My view contains resources but it uses elements with a deferred \nworkbench adapter. Thus, if the view is initializing its children, \na \"Pending...\" object is insterted into the viewer and removed if all children \nare available. If the workbench is closed while the view is initializing (it \ncontaines the \"Pending...\" object) the #saveState can\u0027t cast to IResource.\n\nFrom my understanding the general purpose navigator can also contain elements \nother than resources. Thus, the hard coded cast to IResource should be wrapped \ninto an \"instanceof\" check.",
    "Can you give us a stack trace from your .log file?",
    "ResourceNavigator is not the general purpose navigator.  However, it should\nstill have an instanceof check here.\n",
    "Added instanceof checks."
