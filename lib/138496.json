    "Build: Callisto 3.2 RC1\n\n1) Created a new workspace \"out of the box\" with all Callisto plugins installed.\n2) Created a simple Java project, and added the following class:\n\n\n3) Run \u003e Profile As \u003e Java Application\n4) Select \"Execution Time Analysis\" \n\nAn error dialog opens saying \"One of the selected launch delegates has failed\".  Reason:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.provisional.launcher.AbstractProcessLauncher.configureProcess(AbstractProcessLauncher.java:179)\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.internal.launcher.deleg.application.PIJavaLauncherDelegate.configureProcess(PIJavaLauncherDelegate.java:48)\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.provisional.launcher.PrimaryLaunchDelegate.run(PrimaryLaunchDelegate.java:302)\n  at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:813)",
    "Sorry, forgot to include my test class. This is what I ran the analysis on:\n\npublic class BenchSynchronized {\n\tprivate static final int LOOP \u003d 10000;\n\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\n\t\tnew BenchSynchronized().run();\n\n\tprivate void run() {\n\t\tfor (int i \u003d 0; i \u003c LOOP; i++) {\n\t\t\tsynchronizedMethod();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tprivate synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {\n\t}\n}",
    "Ali, please take a look.",
    "Did you try to run this using a standalone Agent Controller or the integrated version of the Agent Controller?",
    "I ran completely with out of the box default settings.  I don\u0027t know what an \"agent controller\" is, so whatever runs by default is what I was using.",
    "This error is caused because of the client code not being able to establish a connection with the Integrated Agent Controller (IAC).  I am printing a more meaningful message instead of the NPE stack trace.\n\nIt\u0027s very likely that you have run into the following problem:  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d135613 which was fixed yesterday.  The workaround to the problem is to remove your /tmp/IBMRAC directory (this will not be required after our driver picks up the fix from 135613).\n\nIf you can still reproduce the problem, then please open a defect against the following component: Platform.Execution.Framework and prefix the summary with [IAC].\n"
