    "Hello,\n\nI\u0027m not sure if I should submit this against the \"Core\" component. Please \nforward it to the correct component owner.\n\nHere\u0027s my configuration:\nI\u0027m using Eclipse v2.1 (Build id: 200302270800) on Win 2000 with Sun\u0027s JDK \n1.4.1_02.\n\nI\u0027m seeing a weird error message. After posting a question to \"eclipse.tools\" \nabout this message I received a response from Jared Burns who said I should \nreport this as a bug.\n\nDo this to reproduce:\n\n\n1. Navigate the menu options,  \"Run | External Tools | External Tools...\"\n\n2. Click on the \"Program\" item under \"Configurations\" and click the \"New\" \nbutton.\n\n3. In the \"Location\" field enter the name of some program or batch file. It\u0027s \nnot important what you enter, just so it can be run.\n\n4. Make sure \"Run tool in background\" is NOT checked.\n\n5. Click on the \"Refresh\" tab and select the \"Refresh resources after running \ntool\" checkbox. When you do this the ${working_set} scope variable should \nautomatically be selected. In my configuration I do not have any \"working sets\" \ndefined. I think you should do the same to reproduce this experience. In other \nwords, make sure you don\u0027t have any working sets defined.\n\n6. Now click on one of the other scope variables (such as ${workspace}). Now \nclick back onto ${working_set}. In my system I now see a new \"${working_set}\" \nwindow which appears below the \"scope variable\" window. But in order to make \nthis window appear it was necessary to click off the ${working_set} item and \nthen click back on it.\n\n7. Finally, (assuming ${working_set} is selected and you have no working sets \ndefined) if you click the \"Run\" button you should see a dialog message that \nreads, \"An error occurred attempting to expand the variable working_set. No \nworking set defined.\"\n\n\nThe first thing I want to mention is that this dialog only seems to occur if \nthe \"Run tool in background\" option (described in step 4) is not checked. If \nthis option is checked the dialog doesn\u0027t appear. That seems weird and \ninconsistent. If a \"working set\" is required shouldn\u0027t it be required \nregardless of whether or not the tool is run in the background?\n\nThe second thing is that, in my opinion, the error message was very cryptic. I \ndidn\u0027t understand what it was trying to tell me.\n\nFinally, why was it necessary to click off the ${working_set} variable and then \nclick back onto it (described in step 6) in order to make the \"${working_set}\" \nwindow appear?\n\nIf you need any further information please (inluding screen shots) feel free to \ncontact me. \n\nThanks",

If a \"working set\" is required shouldn\u0027t it be required \n\u003e\u003eregardless of whether or not the tool is run in the background?\n\nWe have a general problem of error reporting when the tool is run in the \nbackground. Was anything reported to your .log file?\n\n\u003e\u003eThe second thing is that, in my opinion, the error message was very cryptic. \n\u003e\u003eI didn\u0027t understand what it was trying to tell me.\n\nWe should work on improving this\n\n\u003e\u003eFinally, why was it necessary to click off the ${working_set} variable and \n\u003e\u003ethen click back onto it (described in step 6) in order to make \n\u003e\u003ethe \"${working_set}\" window appear?\n\nSee bug 32700\n",
    "Well, yes, there was something reporting to the .log file, which I\u0027ll describe \nin a moment. Just to make sure you understand, the tool itself is not reporting \nan error. Eclipse is reporting the error about the ${working_set} variable, but \nthe error is reported only if the tool is *not* run in the background.\n\nThe error reported in the .log file is shown below. \n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.debug.ui 4 120 Mar 08, 2003 12:09:04.442\n!MESSAGE Error logged from Debug UI: \n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: An error occurred attempting to expand \nthe variable working_set.

    "Right, when the tool is run in the background we have not created the \ninfrastructure to report into the UI via a dialog.  Logging to the .log is the \ncurrent mechanism that the tool uses (which needs to be improved).\n\nDeferred to post 2.1."
