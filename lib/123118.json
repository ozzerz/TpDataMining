But the bug, \"Cannt connect to VM\", also exists. Why? Why? ... Why? I will be mad! My machine\u0027s OS is Fedora Core 4 (FC4) and its locale is Chinese. Did you try with like this OS? I DO think it also occurs \"Cannt connect to VM\". Maybe Eclipse does NOT fit  on Linux, such as Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core, Free BSD, and so on. While Eclipse ONLY runs on DOS such as Microsoft Windows.",

I think that it is useful-less if one IDE can NOT provide debugging and it is NO meaning if one tool is NOT compatible for Linux (GNU) or is supported by GNU (Linux). Do you think so? Then I NEED your HELP. How can I do for using the Eclipse on GNU Linux in which the GCJ is built, such as Red Hat Linux, Fedora Core? Please tell me how to do. Please help me!\n\nThe YUM (Yellowdog Updater Modified for RPM) tool of my OS is activated to often  update the packages including Eclipse.
