    "I had an established connection with my picl engine and my windows GUI. Some \nfunction breakpoints were set on this engine.  I then tried to connect to the \nsame GUI with gdb.  I got the error below and the connection did not complete \nwhen the engine tried to add the breakpoints.  I tried a couple of times with \nthe same result. I then removed all the breakpoints and tried again and it was \nsuccessful.\n\nI have checked the engine FCT bits using an EPDC trace.  It says that function \nbreakpoints are supported. You could turn this off temporarily if you don\u0027t \nplan \nto support this for the beta.\n\n    9 dbg[1]: GdbPicl: Sending EPDC reply cmd\u003dcom.ibm.debug.gdb.commands.CmdPrep\narePgm@35f53a\n  159 evt[1]: GdbPicl: EPDC_CMD\u003e Location breakpoint\n\n   15 dbg[1]: GdbPicl: Executing command cmd\u003dcom.ibm.debug.gdb.commands.CmdBreak\npointLocation@326af3\nERR[1]: GdbPicl: ######### UNIMPLEMENTED CmdBreakpointLocation.execute **FORCING\n** deferred\u003dfalse;\nERR[1]: GdbPicl: ######## HACK: CmdBreakpointLocation.execute mapping WindowsNam\ne\u003dtestcpp.obj -\u003e LinuxName\u003dtestcpp.c\n\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -2 \u003c 0\n        at java.util.Vector.elementAt(Vector.java:427)\n        at com.ibm.debug.gdb.ModuleManager.getPartIDs(ModuleManager.java:239)\n        at com.ibm.debug.gdb.commands.CmdBreakpointLocation.execute(CmdBreakpoin\ntLocation.java:111)\n        at com.ibm.debug.gdb.CommandProcessor.run(CommandProcessor.java:81)\n\n\n------- Additional Comments From Samantha 2001-11-19 12:16 -------\n\nI have turned off the FCT bit.\nFunction breakpoint will be supported after beta.\nI am leaving his bug as opened as a reminder.",
