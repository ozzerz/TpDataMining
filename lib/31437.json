I then unziped the new version of eclipse (build m4), it  \nunzipped into a directory called eclipse. I didn\u0027t overwrite the old version with the \ncontents of the new zip.

Also it is a big improvement to have ftp downloads on the site as http is not \ngreat for such large files. Thanks for all your help guys.
