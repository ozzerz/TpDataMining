    "Currently g-Eclipse only supports pem-certificates. Now Gilda comes with p12-certs. Since Gilda is very important for g-Eclipse as training site we need support for the Gilda CA. This means:\n\n1) Easy access to Gilda CA cert which is not part of the CA cert distribution already supported by g-Eclipse\n\n2) Conversion from p12 to pem",

    "Both Globus proxies and VOMS proxies may now by generated from p12-certificates. All you have to do is to specify a p12 file instead of a pem file within the proxy wizard. For p12 files no key file is needed since the key is encrypted in the p12 file itself.\n\nThere is a serious issue with p12 certificates. As described in the \"IMPORTANT NOTES\" at http://bouncycastle.org/documentation.html one needs to download the unrestricted policy files for the Sun JCE. Otherwise one gets something like\n\njava.lang.SecurityException: Unsupported keysize or algorithm parameters\n\t\tat javax.crypto.Cipher.init(DashoA6275)\n\t\t\nwhen trying to create a proxy from a p12 file. At the moment there is no easy workaround for this issue.",
