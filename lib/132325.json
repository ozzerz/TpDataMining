    "I had a perfectly fine working version of 3.1.1 (JBoss IDE actually) with several other features installed, subclipse, etc. Everything worked fine. \n\nI installed 3.1.2. I then used our LAN based local update sites to try to reinstall the various features I had. No luck. Any site I use, including remote sites which work perfectly from an identical machine simply come back with a \u0027No features to install\u0027 message. \n\nI try to examine my log file, there is none. Eclipse itself SEEMS to work normally, but all feature management is futile. Rolling back to my previous version now produces the same results. Blowing away my entire workspace AND eclipse and reinstalling EVERYTHING, no dice. No version of eclipse I put on the machine will produce a log file and none of them will install anything.",
