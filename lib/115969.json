    "Description:\nException is thrown in log file and tomcat start console when deploy birt in \nTomcat4.1.31.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Copy birt.war from birt runtime package to tomcat webapp directory.\n2. Start tomcat\n3. Type http://hostname:8080/birt/index.jsp\n4. Click to link to the sample report\n\nResult:\nSee attached two files.\nOne is meta.log in the bin directory of tomcat.\nThe other is Tomcat startup console.\nHowever, the report displayed correctly.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d29754)\ntomcat startup console\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d29755)\nmeta log\n",
    "Tomcat 5.5.7 also has this issue.",
    "Using new web viewer. I can not re-procude this issue. Please verify.",
    "Verified in build 20051223.",
    "The exception still throws out in meta.log but not in Tomcat startup console.\nI tried this in build 20051223.",
    "The exeception is casued by missing an extension point:\n\n Exception [org.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.ExtensionException: Message:The extension point [org.eclipse.birt.report.model.encryptionHelper] is not found. Error code:EXTENSION_POINT_NOT_FOUND \n\tat org.eclipse.birt.report.model.metadata.ExtensionLoader.doLoad(ExtensionLoader.java:114)\n\n\nI guess this is a normal behavior: define an extension but no one extends it.\n\nAlso check with model team see whether this is true.",
    "Check",
    "Verified. It is true that the extension point \"org.eclipse.birt.report.model.encryptionHelper\" defined by Model is never implemented by any extension. \nTherefore, the metda.log figures out some exceptions. Well, the exceptions won\u0027t break the tomcat to go through and run.  ",
