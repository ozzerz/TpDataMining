    "On the menu bar from the main Workbench panel, click File \u003e New \u003e Projects \nSelect CVS  \u003e  Checkout projects from CVS  and click next\n\nThis fails in a Polish locale, but has no problems in english, or any other\nlocale we tried.  \n\nIs it possible that a change in the\neclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui\\plugin.properties file for Polish could\ncause this error?\n\nAttached is the screenshots showing the panel before selecting \"next\" and the\nerror message that is displayed.  You will notice that \"CVS\" was translated in\nPolish to \"System CVS\", but I don\u0027t think that should affect anything.",

    "The error appears to be caused by a failure to load a class (CheckoutWizard). \nI don\u0027t see how the locale could affect class loading. It is more likely an \ninstall issue. How did you install this Eclipse?",
    "We installed the Full SDK on about 6 different machines, all the same way, and\nthe Polish is the only one having a problem.  We can try to re-install and see\nif that fixes it.",
    "I just tried on Windows, and saw the same error message.  It is definitely not\nan install issue, as I just changed the locale to Russian and it worked, and\nthis is on the same machine that it just failed for Polish.\n\nI removed the eclipse\\plugins\\org.eclipse.team.cvs.ui.nl2\\plugin_pl.properties\nfile and the error still occured in the Polish locale.  So that file shouldn\u0027t\nhave anything to do with it.",
    "Pascal, do you have any idea how a change in locale could cause a class \nloading problem.",
    "Is there anything in the log file. Perhaps there is a missing resource that is \ncausing problems.",

    "Here\u0027s the exception related to the failure:\n\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal pattern character \u0027c\u0027\n\tat java.text.SimpleDateFormat.compile(SimpleDateFormat.java:700)\n\tat java.text.SimpleDateFormat.initialize(SimpleDateFormat.java:513)\n\tat java.text.SimpleDateFormat.\u003cinit\u003e(SimpleDateFormat.java:462)\n\tat java.text.SimpleDateFormat.\u003cinit\u003e(SimpleDateFormat.java:443)\n\tat org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.console.CVSOutputConsole.\u003cclinit\u003e\n(CVSOutputConsole.java:60)\n\nThe date format is taken from the message.properties.

One is that the code fails if the entry is \ninvalid. I will fix this so it doesn\u0027t fail. The second is that the Polich \nlocal has an invalid time format.",
    "It appears the english and polish are as follows...\n\nenglish:\nConsole.resultTimeFormat\u003d\u0027(took \u0027m:ss.SSS\u0027)\u0027\n\nPolish\nConsole.resultTimeFormat\u003d(czas: \u0027m:ss.SSS\u0027)\n\n\nSo is the missing single quotes in the Polish property key causing the problem?",
