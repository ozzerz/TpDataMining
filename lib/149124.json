    "Exceptions should be logged instead of written to stdout. Some of these should be rethrown with appropriate status so that a reason for failure is presented in the UI. I think I modified the daytime example to do this already.",
    "With another defect I did remove a lot of the prints.   Is this something you can still reproduce?",
    "The print to stdout does not happen any more. \n\nInstead, after a very long time, RSE shows a dialog:\n  \"Failed to connect...with an unexpected exception.\"\nThe details button shows a \"java.net.ConnectException:Connection timed out\" backtrace.\n\nI think, that trying to connect a host behind a firewall is a rather frequent mis-use, and therefore I\u0027d expect a better error message for this e.g. \"Failed to connect ...: connection timed out. Check if host ... is behind a firewall. See the documentation for help.\" ",
    "Just noticed that in case of the connection timeout, the PDE error log is filled with a message that has the entire exception backtrace. This is about 20 lines high and looks very ugly in the PDE Error log.\n"
