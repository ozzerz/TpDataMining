    "Fixed in HEAD. Marking as 3.2.1 candidate. The user pref string needs to be treated as UTF8.",
    "Fixed in JavaRuntime. Released to 3.2.1 as well.",
    "Please verify, Mike.",
    "I verified we persist/restore non-ascii characters properly now using UTF8, for default VM args. However, retrieving a property with a non-ascii character does not seem to work properly (i.e. System.out.println(System.getProperty(\"x\"));). This is because the VM is launched from the host process, using the system encoding. So, the non-ascii character is not sent to the command line properly. I don\u0027t see a fix to that. The command line will only understand characters in the current system encoding.\n\nI can\u0027t seem to send a unicode character as \\uxxxx to the command line either (haven\u0027t found doc claiming it should work, either).",
