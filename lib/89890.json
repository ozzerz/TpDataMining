    "i20050331\n\n(This might be related to bug 89868)\n\nWhen debugging with plug-ins coming from the target (that I also have in the\nworkspace as source), there are two problems:\n- source for classes in plug-ins coming from the target is not automatically found\n- breakpoint condition \"silently\" fails to evaluate (always stopping) producing\nthe following log entries.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.jdt.debug 4 120 2005-03-31 15:51:04.307\n!MESSAGE Internal error logged from JDI Debug: \n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.core.runtime.CoreException: Unable to compile conditional breakpoint\n- missing Java project context.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaLineBreakpoint.handleConditionalBreakpointEvent(JavaLineBreakpoint.java:474)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaLineBreakpoint.handleBreakpointEvent(JavaLineBreakpoint.java:393)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaBreakpoint.handleEvent(JavaBreakpoint.java:256)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.EventDispatcher.dispatch(EventDispatcher.java:172)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.EventDispatcher.run(EventDispatcher.java:221)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Unknown Source)\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.jdt.debug 4 5012 2005-03-31 15:51:04.323\n!MESSAGE Unable to compile conditional breakpoint - missing Java project context.",
    "If a plugin is external and not referenced by any workspace plugin that you \nare launching with, it will not be on the source lookup path.  Debugger would \nask you to manually attach source.  That is expected behavior as said external \nJAR is not within the Java search scope.\n\nNot sure what the exception below means.",
    "What plug-ins are in your workspace as source? and where is the breakpoint \nlocated?",
    "Plug-in: \norg.eclipse.osgi\n\nBreakpoint:\nPluginConverterImpl [line: 664] [conditional] - convertManifest(File, boolean,\nString, boolean, Dictionary)\n\nCondition:\npluginBaseLocation.getCanonicalPath().indexOf(\"workbench\") \u003e\u003d 0",
    "This worked for me (using latest)\n\n* Started new empty workspace\n* imported org.eclipse.osgi from CVS HEAD\n* added breakpoint as specified with condition\n* launched runtime workbench (with -clean)\n\u003e hit breakpoint several times with nothing in the log.",
    "If I import org.eclipse.osgi as a binary project with linked content, then \nthis error occurrs. ",
    "And with the fix to bug 89489 this scenario also works. Rafael, can you \nconfirm your workspace configuration - i.e. what format is org.eclipse.osgi \nin? source or imported as a binary project?",
    "Re: comment 4 \n\nIt is not clear you tweaked your launch configuration to use org.eclipse.osgi\nfrom the target and not the one from the workspace. That is required to make the\nproblem happen.",
    "Re: comment 6\n\nIt is checked out from HEAD. But when running, I set it to come from the target.",
    "OK, when I change the launch setting to get the org.eclipse.osgi from the \ntarget, I get the same problem. Thanks for the clarification.",
    "The problem is as Wassim describes in comment#1. In this case, the only thing \non the source lookup path is the JRE itself. All other plug-in class files are \nfound in the target (for the runtime), but source lookup is not configured \nproperly to find the source.\n\nAs well, since there is no java project assocaited with the source, we are \nunable to compile\\evaluate conditional expressions.\n\nNeed to discuss with Wassim, as I think there are two issues here:\n(1) PDE may be able to provide a better source lookup path\n(2) Expression evaluation still requires a \"java project\" context in which to \ncompile the expressions",
