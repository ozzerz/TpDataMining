    "Does this go away after you Validate your credentials on the Task Repositories page?\n\nEugene: this looks just like bug 165812, but I thought you got a fix in for that?",
    "This one is different. For some reason posted component id is null in JiraWebIssueService$2.execute(JiraWebIssueService.java:105):\n\n  post.addParameter(\"components\", components[i].getId());\n\nThis shouldn\u0027t be happening, but right now I don\u0027t know why Component.getId() returns null. Seems like general issue in jira services.",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Does this go away after you Validate your credentials on the Task Repositories\n\u003e page?\n\nDo you mean clicking \u0027validate settings\u0027 in Jira Repository Settings dialog? After doing it I get dialog \u0027Valid Jira server found and your login was accepted\u0027. Unfortunatelly after opening jira task from task list and submitting changes I still get already described error.\nI\u0027m using JIRA Enterprise Edition, Version: 3.5.2-#134.\n\n",

No effect - the error is still there. \n\nThat\u0027s strange but for some jira tasks I\u0027m able to add comment and submit changes with no error dialog. Unfortunatelly these comments go to... nowhere - they don\u0027t appear in browser view or JIRA tab after refreshing. There is also no new item in Eclipse\u0027s Error Log view.

    "(In reply to comment #6)\n\u003e Eugene, this sounds like bug#165881 (which was resolved).\n\nI am not sure hot it is related. In this case it seems like for some reason one of the components that is sent to the server has null id. It could either mean that component had been deleted from server after this jira task created in Mylar, or maybe it is a special component type, like \"all\" or \"none\" (I am not sure how those two are handled).",
    "We are nearly frozen for 1.0, I assume that there isn\u0027t anything that we can do here until we get JIRA Core Services in and a reproducible failure?",
    "I\u0027ve got this very same problem on Mylar 1.0 (Eclipse 3.2.1) all installed from the update sites. JIRA Server is Enterprise Edition, Version: 3.4.3-#109. \"Update Attributes\" does not fix this bug.\n\nIs there any workaround?\n\n",
    "The problem is that cached auth token is getting expired and Mylar fail to refresh it in some cases. So, current work around is to open repository settings and hit Validate button. That usually helps...",
    "I\u0027m afraid it does not help in my case. I validated my repository and immediately tried to submit a change to the repository. Same error.\n",
    "Were you able to submit any change at all? Does query work for you?",
    "I haven\u0027t been able to submit any changes yet, but I only tried to add comments so far. Is there something else I should try specifically?\n",

Is there something else I should try specifically?\n\nIs it internal repository? I need to check if it actually work with JIRA 3.4.3. I guess Spring project is using this JIRA version at http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring\n\nCan you try to comment to some other public repository like http://developer.atlassian.com/jira",
    "*** Bug 169289 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "If comments are silently dropped this could be related to Mylar not parsing error messages returned by the server: bug 170718 comment 3. I have opened bug 174788 for fixing that.\n\nIf anyone encounters the original error with the current dev snapshot release, please post an updated stack trace.",
    "Steffen: is this resolved?",
    "No, the original report is probably still valid although we can\u0027t currently reproduce it.\n\nI am not sure how the id / name mapping get\u0027s out of sync but I could add null checks to JiraRepositoryConnector.buildJiraIssue() for now. Once we refactor the attribute related code we can properly fix that.\n",

    "Thanks for the hint Eugene. I was able to reproduce the error once by renaming the component.\n\nI\u0027ll have to investigate how the attribute mapping gets out of sync. I have added the null checks (comment 18) for now.",
    "Marking resolved since exceptions are now caught."
