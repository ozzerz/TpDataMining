    "Can you describe your setup? i.e. What do you mean by \"my Eclipse installation is located at a completely different spot\"",
    "Well, I meant that I didn\u0027t put my Eclipse into c:\\Eclipse, so I am not sure where that path originates from. The source code locations in the PDE preferences also don\u0027t show any such path.\n\nHaving said that, I just found the culprit. The launch configuration I use (of type org.eclipse.pde.ui.RuntimeWorkbench) is a shared one and at its very top it contains that path within the org.eclipse.debug.core.source_locator_memento element. However, I\u0027ve got no idea how it came there nor how to remove it without manually editing the launch configuration.\n\nPlease also note that this was an Eclipse 3.1 share launch configuration that\u0027s stored in our SCM.",
    "Check on the \"Source Lookup\" tab of the launch config to see if the zip in question appears there.",
    "There is no \"Source Lookup\" tab for the Eclipse runtime launcher anymore...",
    "Sounds like on old config that has an old source locator that you can no longer edit.",
    "right.  In the case of something left in the console, PDE delegates to the default source lookup guy as there is no classloader to query.  \n\nLeaving the source tab in is/was not an option, as it would give people the false idea that they have control over the source lookup which they don\u0027t.\n\nThis console stack trace is a case that Darin had forecasted, and the default source lookup seemed not worse than the result the user had before the new PDE source lookup director was installed.",
    "I think the fix is to create a new launch config with the 3.2 tooling. Perhaps PDE should destory old launch config settings for configs with old source locators?",
    "Darin, we still need the old source locator to delegate to it in case the new PDE lookup director fails, right?\n\n",
    "OK, but shouldn\u0027t its path be updated then?",

    "I\u0027m coming from Bug# 136592 https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d136592, which I mis-commented on:\n\nsummary:\nmy Steps to Reproduce:  (comment 9)\n create a project\n  add a library (e.g. foo.jar)\n  add a source library to above library (e.g. bar.zip)\n  create an app that throws an exception and creates a console stacktrace (does not need to involve classes in above jar)\n  run app\n  click on an element in the stacktrace - works fine\n  delete library from filesystem, but not build path\n  you may need to close, delete the file, and reopen the project\n  re-run app\n  click on an element in the stacktrace - failure, popup with details indicating source folder is missing.\n\nSee Davin\u0027s response, in 136592, comment #10, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d136592#c10.\n\nI see the above (this bug, 138877) resolution, and just want to add the comments here to be sure no information is lost.  I can see how on the implementation side the problems I experienced could be one and the same as this bug, but my steps to reproduce were not identical.\n\nI\u0027ll also prefix this that I see there is a fix for this already mentioned, and I actually assume it fixes this - it looks alright - but I\u0027m writing this as if it didn\u0027t.  Again, completeness and the additional reasons that follow.\n\n\u003e The problem in comment#9 is expected - i.e.\n\u003e you\u0027ve clicked on a stack trace for which the source has been deleted, and you\n\u003e get told that an archive is missing.\n\nIt may be expected, but it is still wrong - the code I clicked on had nothing to do with the file missing in the build path.  Essentially, despite the fact there was a valid hit in the existing source, we acted as if there was no match and showed the error.  \n\nThis makes clicking in the console output _useless_ and unusable until I debug my source path.  To do so, I have to hunt through my various projects\u0027s build paths looking for libraries\u0027 dangling source elements, close and reopen the projects, dance in circles and then jangle a little bit of bat guano, just in order to look at a file which I DO readily have access to and is not related to my source problem.  \n\nEven falling back to the byte-code depiction of the class in the library would be preferable, and that would be a good time to show the warning that the source attachment is invalid.\n\n\u003e Note that we\u0027ve improved the error reporting for missing source when an archive\n\u003e goes missing in 3.3 - see bug 138877. The user simply gets a warning now, and\n\u003e nothing is written to the error log.\n\nYou state, \"error reporting for missing source when an archive goes missing\" - that\u0027s not my case.  Just to be clear, the case I\u0027m describing is, \"the source goes missing for a valid archive\".\n\nI have to say this bug is really irritating, especially since it is much more reproducible than the phantom-Console-which-won\u0027t-go-away bug (that bothered me infrequently from 3.0M3 through to 3.2RC4, last time I saw it).  If there is a 3.2.1, and this fixes my issue, I\u0027d really vote this fix to be back-ported. (FWIW! :-))\n\nThis is of course intended as a constructive contribution, if I seem less than so, it really is the irritation with the bug and, of course, not the developers.",
    "apologies :  Davin should be Darin.  Also, poorly cross-referenced comments in the other issue, sorry about that.  You\u0027d think eclipse could use Jira.  ;-)",
    "*** Bug 141546 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "+1 for a backport from me (I don\u0027t know where else to do it)\nThanks!\nJim",
    "Please backport it to 3.2 as it really makes debugging impossible, and though I enjoy the occaissional dance around my desk, my co-workers look at me in funny ways for days when I do so...\n\nIMO, when there are so many duplicates, then a lot of people encounter this problem.",
    "Debug has fixed the following (in 3.3) - we no longer report/log an error when source cannot be found *and* an arhcive goes missing. Instead, we simply offer an \"warning\" dialog saying that source could not be found, and there is a missing archive. \n\nNOTE: We do not fail/abort source lookup when a source path contains one missing archive - we search the entire path for source even if one or more archives are missing. I\u0027ve tested various scenarios to confirm this. We only report an error if the entire path is searched *and* source cannot be found *and* at least one archive is missing.\n\nI do not think this fix will address the problem that most people are encountering. It looks like people are really encountering the problem of a broken build path when migrating from 3.1 to 3.2, and the location of JUnit changing.\n\nSee bug 150961.\n\nFor this reason, I don\u0027t think releasing the \"fix\" for this problem will really be a help in 3.2.1.",
    "I also could not get this problem to happen with any regularity, but with the conditions described in the previous comment, I have not seen an error since.\n\nmarking as verified, if the problem surfaces again by all means reopen.",
    "I have been plagued by this problem ever since Eclipse 3.2 was released.  The whole time I was convinced it was an Eclipse bug, but it isn\u0027t.\n\nI work on a project with several other developers who also use Eclipse.  We keep the .classpath file under version control so that we can share it.  This .classpath file had a reference to the old Eclipse 3.1 path for junitsrc.zip.  Once I updated this to point to the correct path in the Eclipse 3.2 installation, things started working again!\n\nI hope this helps others that have been going crazy with the same issue.\n\n- Mike",
    "If you update eclipse, it does not update your project settings (.classpath, ...). If you got there some links, e.g.,\n\n\u003cclasspathentry kind\u003d\"var\" path\u003d\"JUNIT_HOME/junit.jar\" sourcepath\u003d\"ECLIPSE_HOME/plugins/org.eclipse.jdt.source_3.1.1/src/org.junit_3.8.1/junitsrc.zip\"/\u003e\n\nPointing to locations, which dont exist after the update, you might experience problems.\n\nSo check your project settings, and update the path.",
    "Workaround for 3.2:\n \n- Recursively search for the term \"junitsrc.zip\" in all .classpath files. I used an external editor but Eclipse itself should work just fine.\n- Delete all lines containing the text\n- Search again to make sure they are all removed.\n- Clean/rebuild the entire workspace\n- Fix any projects that need fixing - I had some that had lost all build path settings\n\nThis worked for me. I had searched for junitsrc.zip in the entire eclipse directory + workspaces, but only found entries in the .classpath files. I got the same error message as above, but the error message did not mention which of the dependent projects the error was in. "
