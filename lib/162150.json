    "Hello Martin,\n\nI have a simple HibernateResource with a query, which as I see in my debugger, Hibernate executes correctly and returns a single result. However, Teneo NPEs while trying to make a list for the Hibernate resource. Here is the exception (with some Hibernate debug log prepended):\n\n\nCreating resource with query string: hibernate://?dsname\u003dmatrix\u0026query1\u003dFROM Enterprise ent LEFT JOIN FETCH ent.resourceConfigurations r WHERE r.id\u003d11\n6189 [main] DEBUG org.hibernate.SQL  - select enterprise0_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\" as id1_1_0_, resourceco2_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\" as id1_1_1_, enterprise0_2_._vn_ as column2_1_0_, enterprise0_2_.\"name\" as name3_1_0_, enterprise0_2_.\"description\" as descript4_1_0_, enterprise0_1_.\"createdby\" as createdby2_4_0_, enterprise0_1_.\"modifiedby\" as modifiedby3_4_0_, enterprise0_1_.\"creationdate\" as creation4_4_0_, enterprise0_1_.\"modificationdate\" as modifica5_4_0_, enterprise0_.\"admincluster_id\" as adminclu2_36_0_, resourceco2_2_._vn_ as column2_1_1_, resourceco2_2_.\"name\" as name3_1_1_, resourceco2_2_.\"description\" as descript4_1_1_, resourceco2_1_.\"createdby\" as createdby2_4_1_, resourceco2_1_.\"modifiedby\" as modifiedby3_4_1_, resourceco2_1_.\"creationdate\" as creation4_4_1_, resourceco2_1_.\"modificationdate\" as modifica5_4_1_, resourceco2_.\"type\" as type2_55_1_, resourceco2_.\"contents\" as contents3_55_1_, resourceco2_.econtainer_class as econtainer4_55_1_, resourceco2_.e_container as e5_55_1_, resourceco2_.e_container_featureid as e6_55_1_, case when resourceco2_3_.\"resourceconfiguration_id\" is not null then 22 when resourceco2_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\" is not null then 11 end as clazz_1_, resourceco1_.id as id0__, resourceco1_.elt as elt0__, resourceco1_.\"enterprise_resourceconfigurations_idx\" as enterprise3_0__ from \"enterprise\" enterprise0_ inner join \"simpleeditableentity\" enterprise0_1_ on enterprise0_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\"\u003denterprise0_1_.\"adminentity_id\" inner join \"adminentity\" enterprise0_2_ on enterprise0_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\"\u003denterprise0_2_.\"id\" left outer join enterprise_resourceconfiguration resourceco1_ on enterprise0_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\"\u003dresourceco1_.id left outer join \"resourceconfiguration\" resourceco2_ on resourceco1_.elt\u003dresourceco2_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\" left outer join \"simpleeditableentity\" resourceco2_1_ on resourceco2_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\"\u003dresourceco2_1_.\"adminentity_id\" left outer join \"adminentity\" resourceco2_2_ on resourceco2_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\"\u003dresourceco2_2_.\"id\" left outer join \"servicebustransportconfiguration\" resourceco2_3_ on resourceco2_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\"\u003dresourceco2_3_.\"resourceconfiguration_id\" where resourceco2_.\"simpleeditableentity_id\"\u003d11\n6299 [main] DEBUG org.hibernate.SQL  - select adminclust0_.e_id as e1_86_0_, adminclust0_._vn_ as column2_86_0_, adminclust0_.\"clustername\" as clustern3_86_0_, adminclust0_.econtainer_class as econtainer4_86_0_, adminclust0_.e_container as e5_86_0_, adminclust0_.e_container_featureid as e6_86_0_ from \"admincluster\" adminclust0_ where adminclust0_.e_id\u003d?\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.emf.teneo.resource.StoreResource.attachedHelper(StoreResource.java:473)\nat org.eclipse.emf.teneo.resource.StoreResource.attached(StoreResource.java:425)\nat org.eclipse.emf.teneo.resource.StoreResource.load(StoreResource.java:252)\n\nThe exception seems to occur because StoreResource.attachedHelper is handed a null object. This in turn happens because getNonResolvingContent(eObject).basicIterator() returns an iterator which has null objects in it. What exactly is getNonResolvingContent(eObject)? eObject in my case has the real object i.e. the only result that Hibernate returned.\n\nWhen I put an NPE check in StoreResource.attachedHelper, everything is fine. Is this a good enough fix (and should I file a bug report), or is the problem happening in the first place because of some earlier mistake on my part?\n\nThanks much,\n\nSundeep",
    "In the 0.7.5 I200611140944 build I changed the logic around this iterator for other reasons. Can you check if this error still occurs? I can\u0027t reproduce it so I do not know if this build/change solves it.\n\ngr. Martin",
    "Hi Sundeep,\nCan you let me know if this issue still occurs with the latest release?\n\ngr. Martin",
    "Set to WORKSFORME because it it not reproducable.\nPlease reopen this issue if it still applies. \n\ngr. Martin"
