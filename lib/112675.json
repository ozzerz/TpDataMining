    "In recent AJDT builds the plugins have further split... the org.aspectj.ajde\nplugin used to contain the compiler and the weaver, it now contains just the\ncompiler and the new org.aspectj.weaver plugin contains the weaver.  Looking at\nyour error it seems you are using ajde.jar but not the corresponding weaver.jar.\n Since AjBuildManager is in ajde.jar and BcelWeaver is in the weaver.jar\n\nHow is your build process constructed?  Is it ANT, if so whats the classpath you\nare using?  Does it include the weaver jar if you are using the plugin jars\nrather than aspectjtools from the 1.5.0M4 installation of aspectj?",

    "I tried with last build of ajdt and nothing better. I also tried to use the last build of aspectj (aspectjtool \nfor ajde.jar, aspectjrt.jar and aspectweaver.jar) and neither it helps.\n\n\n\nThanks for helping me in solving this boring problem.\n\neclipse.buildId\u003dM20050929-0840\njava.version\u003d1.5.0_02\njava.vendor\u003dApple Computer, Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dmacosx, ARCH\u003dppc, WS\u003dcarbon, NL\u003den_US\nFramework arguments:  -keyring /Users/omotelet/.eclipse_keyring -showlocation\nCommand-line arguments:  -os macosx -ws carbon -arch ppc -keyring /Users/\nomotelet/.eclipse_keyring -consoleLog -showlocation\n",

    "Using aspectjtools.jar as a replacement for ajde/weaver/runtime is dangerous -\nyou will be lucky if anything works if you do that since the jars in those\nplugins are careful subsets of the contents of aspectjtools.\n\nWith the change to make reweavable default the signature for\nBcelWeaver.setReweavableMode() changed from:\n\n\tpublic void setReweavableMode(boolean mode,boolean compress)\n\nto\n\n\tpublic void setReweavableMode(boolean xNotReweavable)\n\nYour version of AjBuildManager.initBcelWorld() is calling the new version of\nsetReweavableMode (which takes just a boolean) but it looks like you may be\nrunning with an old version of the weaver jar.  Have you ever copied any part of\nAspectJ into the standard extensions folder of your VM - such that it will be\nfound ahead of the version in the plugins?  Any version of aspectjtools lying\naround could have the old version of this class in which is missing the form of\nsetReweavableMode that you need.\n\nCan you go into the weaver plugin and javap org.aspectj.weaver.bcel.BcelWeaver\nand check what version of setReweavableMode is reported.\n\nHave you got another level of the VM you can try?",
    "Hi Oliver - I have OS X 10.4.2 and Eclipse 3.1.1 with several projects in the \nworkspace.  I just upgraded from AJDT 1.3.0.20051012.. to 1.3.0.20051017.. \nwithout any problems.  If you did something unusual when you upgraded it might \nbe worth trying to upgrade again to the latest version and see if that works \nfor you.",
    "Effectively Eclipse was using 2 version of aspectj. The other one was dated from the day I updated to \n3.1.1. I do not know what occured then. \nI reinstall all and now it works ok.\n\nThanks a lot for your help and your great work!\n\nOlivier",
