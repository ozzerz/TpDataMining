    "Hello,\nI am getting the following error messages while saving a *.java file.

    "I\u0027m getting the same stack trace when saving a java file (compiling).\nDoing a Project-\u003eclean gets the project to compile, but problem returns the next time I try to save.  Also found that restarting Eclipse makes the problem go away breifly, but it eventually comes back after doing a few saves.  Can\u0027t see any pattern to when it starts failing (after restart, it failed on saving a different class than it was failing on before the restart).\n\nIn my case, It\u0027s failing to comple a class that simply uses advised objects, and is not advised itself.\n\nMy code uses an aspect to apply an interface to POJOs that have a specific Annotation:\n\n@Target({ElementType.TYPE})\n@Retention(value\u003dRetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)\npublic @interface MyAnnotation {\n}\n\n@MyAnnotation\npublic class MyClass {\n...\n}\n\npublic interface MyInterface {\n...\n}\n\npublic aspect MyInterfaceAspect {\n   declare parents: (@MyAspect *) implements MyInterface\n...\n}\n\npublic class MyService {\n\n    public void doSomething(MyClass obj) {\n        MyInterface mi \u003d (MyInterface) obj;\n        ...\n    }\n}\n\nSaving (compiling) the \"MyService\" eventually fails.\n\n\nUsing\n- Eclipse Version: 3.2.2\n- JRE 6 (Compiler compliance set to 5)\n- AJDT 1.4.2.200703020612 (Dev)\n- AspectJ 1.5.4.200701151324\n",
    "The following bugs look suspiciously like this one.  Are these all the same?\n\nbug #165787\nbug #169605\nbug #175039\nbug #178379\n",
    "this is a long shot but I have some development time now.  Do you by any chance have time to try some debug builds for me to investigate this problem?",
    "As Christopher says in comment 3, those bugs are all related.  Having had time to look through them, I am closing this as a dup of bug 175039.  That bug covers the same stack trace but also includes an explanation of the problem and a fix was put in under that bug on the 6Mar2007.  Of all these similar bugs I have yet to see one reported on an AspectJ level after the 6Mar2007\n\nthis one raised against an AJDT of 1Jan2007\nComment 2 AspectJ level 15Jan2007\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of bug 175039 ***"
