    "Please can support for SSPI (Windows-specific) and gserver (UNIX + Kerberos \nequivalent) protocols be added, to facilitate integration with CVSNT? NetBeans \nhandles this by allowing the user to specify a different CVS binary and talking \nto that, rather than using the built-in CVS client; maybe this is easier.\n\nJon.",
    "From mailing list posting by Rolf Wilms.....\n\nThere is an implementation of the sserver protocol for both CVS and CVSNT \navailable here:\n\nhttp://home.arcor.de/rolf_wilms/cvsssl/cvsssl_help.html\n\nLike sspi, sserver supports encrypted connections but uses SSL rather than \nsspi. The benefit is that it also works with non-Windows clients. The \ndrawback is that it does not support single sign-on. Please note that the \ncurrent implementation of that plugin does not work with M6. M5 has been \nreported to work.\n\nRegards,\nRolf",

    "I got bored and frustrated enough one day to write a SSPI plug-in for Eclipse \nCVS.  The company I work for decide to use CVSNT with SSPI authentication, \nand are still having meetings on whether or not to enable PServer so that \nnon-windows clients and IDEs that don\u0027t support SSPI can use the archive.  \nAnyway, to make a long story short, here is the source.  I don\u0027t want to \nmaintain it so I am giving it up to the masses.  It uses code from the CVSNT \ncode base so it has to be GPL (I know, I don\u0027t like GPL either).  It wouldn\u0027t \nbe too hard to re-write the whole thing from scratch to lose the GPL virus, I \njust don\u0027t have time.\n\nhttp://www.pogozone.net/projects/sspi-plugin-source.zip\n\n-- \nJacob S.

    "Created an attachment (id\u003d34168)\nPlugin that allows GSSAPI access via GServer\n\nI\u0027ve written a fragment to the existng 3.1 CVS server that uses GSSAPI to authenticate against the remote CVS server using the :gserver: protocol. This should be adaptable to any GSSAPI protocol, but at present, it assumes the use of kerberos to perform the authentication.\n\nThis has been tested on Mac OS X 10.4 as client, and 10.4 Server as the server. I\u0027ll report as I find out it works on other combinations.\n\nYou need to ensure that you run \u0027kinit\u0027 to obtain a Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) before you try to run the CVS :gserver: operations. Otherwise, it hangs (actually, it\u0027s asking for your userid/password from the console, but that doesn\u0027t work for obvious reasons).\n\nThis will only work on systems that meet:\nEclipse 3.1\nKerberos V5 KDC already configured for the OS you\u0027re using\nJava 1.4\n\nThere\u0027s a README.TXT file in the plugin (which can be dropped straight in; it also contains the source as well if you want to investigate/extend/play around with it\n\nI plan to make updates to this to make it production ready; at present, it\u0027s alpha stage. That is, I\u0027ve checked stuff in and out with it already, but it\u0027s not as foolproof as it could be.\n\nNote that there are some setup required on the KDC:\ncvs/my.host.name needs to be created as a principal (and exported to the keytab where the CVS server can find it)\nThere may be some encryption methods needed to be set up on the server (documented in README.TXT)\n\nIn short, don\u0027t try this unless you already have a working CVS server that supports :gserver:, and you\u0027re able to run a cvs -d :gserver:some.host.name/some/root/name checkout someproject. \n\nPlease Cc feedback/reports to this bug, or to my mail address. I\u0027ll improve this and put a new version up at a later stage. Given that it\u0027s only really 2 files, I don\u0027t see an issue in uploading the plugin that you can just drop into the plugins directory, but if anyone objects I\u0027ll stop doing that.\n\nAlex.",
    "I\u0027ve created a new attachment which has a plugin for :gserver: support. It\u0027s written in pure Java, and uses libraries in Java 1.4 to perform authentication against system credentials. There\u0027s a readme file (and source) in the plugin itself, but you should just be able to drop it into a plugins/ directory to get it to work.\n\nNote that you must run kinit to obtain credentials first; it ignores whatever userid/password you put in. \n\nThis has only been tested on Mac OS X, so I\u0027d be interested if anyone can get it to work on other systems. There are some known issues in the README.TXT file in the jar with some debugging steps if it doesn\u0027t work. Please leave feedback on this bug and I\u0027ll pick it up and try to improve the next version.\n\nHopefully if it works well enough and I can tidy it up, it can be adopted in the 3.2 stream; there\u0027s some refactoring that could be done with the existing PServer classes, and I\u0027m happy to volunteer to do that; but I want to ensure that we iron out all the bugs before doing the refactoring step :-)\n\nAlex.",
    "Do you think it is possible to write the sspi authentication in pure Java?",
    "The plugin that I\u0027ve written (in 2006) is pure Java, if you\u0027re asking me. The plugin of 2004 isn\u0027t.\n\nIf you\u0027re asking whether it could be re-implmented to do the authentication outside of the JAAS/GSSAPI framework built in to Java, I don\u0027t see why not, but I don\u0027t see the point either.",
    "Alex, I was asking for sspi authentication, not gserver. Or could gserver be used also on Windows as a sspi alternative? Sorry, I\u0027m not that familiar with these OS-specific authentication methods.",
    "GSSAPI authentication is a generic form of authentication. It so happens that it can use Kerberos authentication, but it can handle other forms. SSPI is Microsoft\u0027s specific extensions to GSSAPI that are probably incompatible. However, if you\u0027re using an Active Directory setup to perform authentication, then essentially GSSAPI and SSPI are equivalent.\n\nSince SSPI is a native protocol to windows, it\u0027s got to have a native hook to call the Windows methods. However, the GSSAPI libraries on each platform integrate with credentials, so you might find that you can use the gserver mechanism instead of the SSPI one.",
    "FYI I\u0027ve tested this on a windows system, and it didn\u0027t find krb5.ini so gave up. It should be getting the info from the windows system rather than expecting to see a file, so I\u0027ll do some more digging and see if I can find out what\u0027s going wrong.",
