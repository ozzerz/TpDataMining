    "With 3.0RC3 on Debian testing, I\u0027m trying to debug a program.  The first time I\ncan debug ok.  Some time after that, (not exactly sure when and not completely\nreproducible), trying to debug gives no response.  On the console I fired up\neclipse from, I see:\n\njlquinn@tiamat:~$ java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java(Compiled\nCode))java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java(Compiled\nCode))java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java(Compiled\nCode))java.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java(Compiled Code))",
    "CC John (A). The NPE looks like job code, but there is not much info from the \ntrace. Is there something else in your log, Jerry?",
    "Closing. Please re-open with steps to reproduce or with .log file attached if \nthis continues to be a problem.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d12768)\nlog file\n\nLog doesn\u0027t seem to show anything useful to me",
    "Reopened.  I know I can reproduce it by just doing some debugging, but I don\u0027t\nknow if it\u0027s related to my workspace or what.",
    "Just saying \"it happens\" isn\u0027t much of a help to us :-) What\u0027s in your .log \nfile?",
    "(Oops didn\u0027t see comment#3 - bugzilla mail is out of order).",
    "After this happens, I don\u0027t seem to be able to debug or run anymore.",
    "I noticed you using a 1.4.1 VM - can you try a 1.4.2 VM? It may be a JIT bug.",
    "I\u0027ve been using IBM\u0027s 1.4.1-0.0 java rpm.  I just pulled down 1.4.1-2.0, so will\ntry again.",
    "The same problem still shows up quite quickly with the IBM java 1.4.1-2.0 jdk. \nSo far, it doesn\u0027t show up quickly with Sun 1.4.2_01.\n\nI\u0027ll keep looking out for it.",
    "Note that there is also an IBM 1.4.2 VM.",
    "How do I find it?  I checked the IBM java site and only found 1.4.1 (for linux)",
    "This could be a duplicate of bug 68452",
    "*** Bug 68875 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Andrew, please state what VM you are using, and attach the log file if it\ncontains anything from the time of the crash.",
    "The .log file doesn\u0027t contain anything.\nThe jvm I was using is IBM\u0027s 1.4.1 \nClassic VM (build 1.4.1, J2RE 1.4.1 IBM build cxia321411-20030930 (JIT enabled)\n\nIf I switch to \nClassic VM (build 1.4.2, J2RE 1.4.2 IBM build cxia32dev-20040524 (JIT enabled)\nor with -vmargs -Xj9:    J2RE 1.4.2 IBM J9 build 20040519 (JIT enabled)\nthen it doesn\u0027t seem to happen anymore.",
    "Jerry, when you said that this bug \"doesn\u0027t show up quickly\" on JDK 1.4.2, do\nyou mean that you weren\u0027t able to reproduce it after brief testing or that you\ndid reproduce it but only after a few tries? What I really want to know is if\nthis has been reproduced on a VM other than IBM 1.4.1. Either way, can you\nreproduce the problem on Eclipse 3.0?",
    "So far I haven\u0027t seen it at all under Sun 1.4.2.  I also have not seen it under\n3.0 final with the IBM jvm, so hopefully it got squashed.",
    "Ok. So it was either a dup of bug 68452 or a bug in IBM 1.4.1.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d13067)\nlog file\n\nLog file for problem under eclipse 3.0 release",
    "This just happened for me with released eclipse 3.0.  The second attached log\nfile is from 3.0 release.  Still IBM JVM 1.4.1_3.0.0\n",
    "Comment #19 sounds correct to me. This looks like a bug in the IBM 1.4.1_X VMs. Has anyone seen this \non a 1.4.2 VM?",
    "Moving to JCORE. Could be a JRE bug, but the NPEs are coming from JCORE, not \nJDT-DEBUG.",
    "NPE is in code used by indexer. Kent please have a look and close as VM bug if \neverything is fine on our side.",
    "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 69545 ***"
