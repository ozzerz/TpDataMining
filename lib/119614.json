    "Im using mylar 0.4.4 on eclipse-SDK-I20051206-1200 on MacOS X 10.4.3 with java 1.5.0_05-83. \n\nAfter I installed mylar i started to get some exceptions like the one bellow in my console.log:\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.jface 4 2 2005-12-07 12:49:40.025\n!MESSAGE Problems occurred when invoking code from plug-in: \"org.eclipse.jface\".\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/eclipse/core/internal/commands/util/Assert\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.java.ui.editor.AbstractMylarHyperlinkDetector.setEditor(AbstractMylarHyperlinkDetector.java:38)\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.java.ui.editor.MylarJavaSourceViewerConfiguration.readDetectorsExtension(MylarJavaSourceViewerConfiguration.java:159)\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.java.ui.editor.MylarJavaSourceViewerConfiguration.getHyperlinkDetectors(MylarJavaSourceViewerConfiguration.java:120)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.text.source.SourceViewer.configure(SourceViewer.java:366)\n\nI will attach the full stacktrace.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d31286)\nFull stacktrace\n\n",
    "Thanks for the report, it\u0027s probably a dependency change in the latest build.  I\u0027m like to wait until the next to-last integration build to move support to the latest milestone, so plan on doing this next Monday.  In the meantime, if it\u0027s the only failure that you are getting it\u0027s probably fine to continue working with Mylar since all it will be missing is some editor support.  But annoyingly this exception will show up every time that you open an editor. ",
    "*** Bug 119835 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d31457)\nPatch\n\nReplaces usage of internal Assert class with an API version",
    "Thanks Brock, I applied the patch, but am removing the Assert which wouldn\u0027t help much anyway (NPE will be fine) in case this is our only compile incompatability between M3 and M4.  I\u0027ll figure that out on Monday.",
    "with N20051209-0010\nThere are a few other problems:\n\nSearchScope has been removed and has been replaces with TextSearchScope (and a search engine).  I have managed to get the active search running again, but it won\u0027r work in M3 and M4.  The search could also be re-written to use only API classes now, but it is a fairly large change.\n\nException is thrown when opening the Plugin editor.  The reflection hacks no longer work, but should be fixable.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d31513)\nPDE UI bridge patch\n\nThe form outline field was renamed from formOutline to fFormOutline.  This change is compatible with M3",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d31515)\nXML Search patch\n\nPatch to make the XML search use the new Text search API.  This patch is not compatible with M3 and still uses a bunch of internal API.",
    "Thanks Brock!  I\u0027ll apply these patches on Monday when I move to the integration build.",
    "Btw, don\u0027t worry too much about M3 compatability because I\u0027ve always been clear that the latest Mylar will only support the latest milestone, in order to avoid managing more than 2 branches.",
    "Patches applied, thanks Brock!  Btw, how did you manage to notice that the name of the filed accessed reflectively by the PDE stuff changed?\n\nI also had to mofify some of the FilteredTree code used by the task list.  All tests pass, and I\u0027m now working in an M4 build. ",
    "(In reply to comment #11)\n\u003e Patches applied, thanks Brock!  Btw, how did you manage to notice that the name\n\u003e of the filed accessed reflectively by the PDE stuff changed?\nI think there was a warning in my log file.  Everything else seemed to work ok though.\n\n",
    "Great that you found that.  \n\nThe filtering wasn\u0027t working properly and I have hundreds of completed tasks in my list, so I was pretty shocked when I first launched ;)"
