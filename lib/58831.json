I removed the corrupted file and eclipse started ok.\n\nI am using Eclipse M8 with Sun JRE 1.4.2_02",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d9575)\nCorrupted workspace.xml\n",
    "Yahsu,\n\nThere were a couple of problems here:\n1. If after restoring the previous state there are no windows open, the\nworkbench should open the default one.  It was failing to do this.\n2. refreshLocal was assuming there was at least one window.\n\nIs there anything in your .log indicating how the workbench.xml got corrupted in\nthe first place?\n",
    "Hi there,\nThanks for the quick reply!\n\nUnfortunately I erased the log file so I don\u0027t know what exactly corrupted my\nworkbench.xml file. But are some clues to help you investigate it.\n\nI tried to open a file in a third party editor.\nEclipse reported a serious error and suggested to me to restart the workbench.\n\nWhen I pressed the x button to shutdown Eclipse the eclipse window dissapeared\nbut eclipse was still running.\nI noticed that only when I tried to logoff (then the workspace save progress bar\nappeard).\nWhen I logged on and tried to open eclipse again it couldn\u0027t start.\n\nThere is a similar posting in the newsgroups (eclipse.platform) copying...\n\nSubject: M8: killed it, now it won\u0027t start\nHad a JUnit tests that ran out of memory, and eclipse stopped responding.\nHad to kill javaw in the task manager (windows XP).\n\nNow it won\u0027t start again.  When I try to start it, a javaw process\ninitializes to about 32MB, then nothing.\n\n.metadata/.log has no new errors after my OutOfMemory from this morning, no\npop-up-window with a message.  If I try to start it again (which usually\ngives the \"already got eclipse running\" error, I get an error telling me\nthat it cannot connect to the workspace.",
    "Thanks for the additional info.  Not sure what the problem was on shutdown, but\nthe \"phantom eclipse\" on startup would be explained by it failing to open the\nfirst time window if it could not restore any.  It would just come up and sit\nthere with no windows.\n",
    "BTW, what part of Greece are you from? Back in 1999 I had a wonderful trip\nthere, mainly sailing around the Dodecanese.\n",
    "Unfortunately I live in Athens. Dodecanese are great and I would like to be able\nto live there. But it\u0027s hard to find work as a programmer in these places.\n\nIt must be great working for eclipse.org! I wish I could do that as my primary job."
