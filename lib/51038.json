    "I was just going from breakpoint to breakpoint, when Eclispe (M6) died.\n\n(This total death on a single exception is very aggrevating. I\u0027m sure you can \ncome up with a better way of getting us to report bugs without tossing away \nthe work-in-progress).\n\n!MESSAGE Internal error logged from JDI Debug: \n!STACK 0\njava.lang.ClassCastException\n        at \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.eval.ast.instructions.Instruction.popValue\n(Instruction.java:115)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.eval.ast.instructions.PushFieldVariable.execute\n(PushFieldVariable.java:49)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.eval.ast.engine.Interpreter.execute\n(Interpreter.java:50)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.eval.ast.engine.ASTEvaluationEngine$1\n$EvaluationRunnable.run(ASTEvaluationEngine.java:303)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.model.JDIThread.runEvaluation\n(JDIThread.java:651)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.eval.ast.engine.ASTEvaluationEngine$EvalRunnable\n.run(ASTEvaluationEngine.java:340)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.model.JDIThread$ThreadJob.run\n(JDIThread.java:2497)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:62)",
    "I\u0027m not sure the stack trace is releavant for the problem. Worker.run() handles\ncorrectly all exceptions, not exception generated by a job would kill the VM.\n\nBob, are you sure this exception caused the VM to die ? Didn\u0027t you get any other\nerror in the console (if you were running from a console) ? Which VM are you using ?\n\nWere you using conditionnal breakpoints ? or watch expressions ?\nThe stack trace was generated by an exception during an evaluation, it may be an\nerror that occured before the crash. Do you have any idea of which evaluation\ncould have generated this error ?",
    "Well, since I wasn\u0027t stepping through the debugger in a debugger, I can\u0027t be \ncertain that the exception in the log is really the one that killed it. Here\u0027s \nwhat I CAN say:\n\n* The exception in the log was very close in time to when it died.\n* It seems much more likely to die if I use conditional breakpoints, and I was \nusing one when it died this time.\n* I have since noted that I sometimes get deaths when debugging for which NO \nlog entry occurs. This would support the idea that this wasn\u0027t the cause, but \nwould also support the idea that there is an additional problem that is not \nlogged.\n\nEither way, there is a problem where fatal errors are not logged. (In the \nmeantime, the log is flooded with stack traces for every unsuccessful attempt \nto contact an update site -- realy a separate report of course, but pointed \nout here for the sake of irony. I\u0027ll report it so you needn\u0027t bother \nseparating this out ;\u003d).",
    "Bob: Can you try to launch Eclipse from a console, and try to crash it ? the VM\nshould print out data about why it died.",
    "I just discovered the separate log files it dumps in the root directory when \nit crashes. It seems this is an access violation in the SWT native code. I \nguess that would make this a platform problem. "
