    "Build Id: 200309250800\n\nWhenever the new synchronize view is refreshing, I get a busy cursor and can\u0027t\ndo anything else within Eclipse. This got particularly bad today when our CVS\nserver was taken down. Whenever Eclipse tried to connect to the server, I had to\nwait for the socket timeout before I got control back.\n\nClosing the synchronize view in the open perspective didn\u0027t help, however (I\nstill get socket timeouts in the log, so I guess the synchronization is still\nrunning somewhere)\n\nIn my synchronize Preferences, I have both options in the \u0027Refreshing with\nremote\u0027 section checked.\n\n\n\nLance",

    "When the background sync is running we change the cursor to the \u0027arrow-with-busy\u0027. this is only \nsupported on some platforms, but when not supported defaults to the simple arrow. I\u0027ve tried to \nduplicate this problem on the Mac and was unsuccessful. When the background refresh is \nhappening the view and Eclipse is responsive. Also, if I disconnect the network cable to simulate a \nserver that is down, Eclipse remains responsive but the refresh job returns an error.\n\nPlease re-open if you still have this problem. I suspect though that some other plugin was actually \nto blame, while running a long operation in the UI thread.\n\n"
