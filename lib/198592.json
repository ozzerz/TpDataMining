    "Build ID:  I20070625-1500\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\n1. Look at the ZIP I will attach of a Plug-in from existing JAR files\n2. Note that in the Package Explorer commons-lang.jar does not show a package org/apache/commons/lang/enum\n3. Run jar -tf commons-lang.jar and notice the package is there\n\nMore information:\n\nI ran into this problem converting from 3.2.2 to 3.3.  Several\nplug-ins that only contain 3rd party JAR files, reported errors in\nMANIFEST.MF after the conversion.  These errors say:\n\n\"package \u0027xxx\u0027 does not exist in this plug-in\"\n\nThe xxx package also does not appear when you expand the JAR file in\nPackage Explorer or Navigator.  These projects showed no errors in\nEclipse 3.2 (and earlier versions), and the packages did appear in the\nProject Explorer.  The packages (or at least the directories) _are_ in\nthe JAR file.\n\nIt can be verified that the packages are there by using \"jar tf\n\u003cjar-name\u003e\" or WinZip.\n\nIf you make a new \"Plug-in from existing JAR archives\", these packages\nare not in the created MANIFEST.MF nor do they show in Project\nExplorer (so there are no errors indicated).  However, they _are_\nstill in the JAR file.  I have tried this in a clean Eclipse 3.3 in a\nclean workspace with no extra plug-ins installed.\n\nI note that in some cases these are not really packages, but are\ndirectories of, say, html files.  However, other such directories do\nshow.  Also I have at least one example of a directory (and presumably\npackage) with .class files.\n\nI also note that this is reproducible but apparently random.  Most JAR\nfiles work OK and most packages are shown in the ones that don\u0027t work.\nThe ones with problems have the same problem in different instances\nof Eclipse (to the extent I have tested).\n\nI will attach a ZIP of a project I made using \"Plug-in from existing\nJAR archives\" with some of the bad JAR files.  They are all 3rd party\nand not my files.\n\nThese are the problem packages in the project.\n\ncommons-lang.jar:\norg.apache.commons.lang.enum\n\nIsaw.jar:\nIsawHelp.viewers.3D_view_files\nbut not other, similar IsawHelp.viewers.*\n\nsgt_vz.jar:\ngov.noaa.pmel.sgt.*.class-use (11 total)\n\nThanks,\n\n     -Ken",

However the folder \"3D_view_files\" appears under the package \"IsawHelp.viewers\".\n\n\"gov.noaa.pmel.sgt.*.class-use\" are not valid package names. But each parent package contains the folder \"class-use\" as expected.\n\nMaybe you are using the Package Explorer filter to filter out Non-Java Elements ?",
    "\u003e\u003e Maybe you are using the Package Explorer filter to filter out Non-Java Elements\n\nIf so, I didn\u0027t do anything to make that happen.  I, in fact, don\u0027t know how to do that.  I am using the same workspace as I was before upgrading to 3.3, and I have not changed any preferences related to Project Explorer.  (The Eclipse 3.3 is a clean install, but using the old workspace.)  The non-Java elements show as white.\n\n\u003e\u003e I\u0027m seeing \"org.apache.commons.lang.enum\" in \"commons-lang.jar\".\n\nI do not.  See attached screen dump.  It also shows what I get for gov.noaa.sgt.*.\n\nExcept for the Apache one, it is true they are not valid packages.  However, it shows some of these and not others (for me).  The same is true of the Isaw.jar, but there was not enough room in the screen dump.\n\nI do not have this problem with my old 3.2.2 Eclipse, which is still running on my laptop.  I see all the packages, valid or not.\n\nIn addition, the 3.2.2 (or previous) wizard put all the valid and invalid packages in MANIFEST.MF.  The 3.3 version seems to not put the invalid ones, which is good.  I noticed the problem because the ones that were put in by 3.2.2 became errors when converted to 3.3.  The reason is, the same as for the project Explorer, that Eclipse doesn\u0027t see them.  (For me, anyway).  Note that Eclipse 3.3 does not mark invalid packages as errors, just the ones it thinks are missing.\n\nAs stated in the original post, I have tried this in a clean Eclipse 3.3 in a\n_clean_ workspace with no extra plug-ins installed, and get the same result (missing packages as in the screen dump).\n\nThanks for looking at this.\n\n",

    "I now understand the problem with \"org.apache.commons.lang.enum\". The compliance of your project is 1.5. In 1.5 \"enum\" is a reserved keyword and thus \"org.apache.commons.lang.enum\" is not a valid package name. The problem is that we don\u0027t show \"enum\" as a non-Java element. We should fix that.\n\n\u003e  However, it shows some of these and not others (for me).\nCould you please elaborate ? What exact packages doesn\u0027t it show that it should show ?",

However, in what I did expand, there should be \"gov.noaa.pmel.sgt.class-use\".  Presumably you would see this whereas it is not in the screen dump.  It would be useful to determine what is different about your situation compared to mine.  This happens for me on three machines, two with XP and one with Vista.

If I change the compliance to 1.4, it still does not show.  Moreover, the proper behavior would be to display the package with an error (or possibly a warning for 1.4 compliance), not to just omit it.  Omiting it is user unfriendly and is of no help in fixing the problem.\n\nPlease note that these are 3rd-party JARs, not mine.  I am just wrapping them, as that is the best, if not the only feasible, way to use them in Eclipse.  I am not at liberty to change them.\n\nThanks,\n\n     -Ken",

    "I observe the very same behavior with a new installation of Eclipse 3.3, using Java 1.5 compliance settings, and the following package names:\n\norg.apache.axis.enum\ncom.esri.mo2.res.ico.bean.16\ncom.esri.mo2.res.ico.bean.32\ncom.esri.mo2.res.ico.bean.64\n\nI have tried creating new packages with names ending in \u0027enum\u0027, \u002716\u0027, etc., and the New Java Package window states, for example, \"Invalid package name. \u0027enum\u0027 is not a valid Java identifier\".  This is correct behavior.\n\nCertainly it is appropriate to restrict creation of such packages, but I need to export the 3rd party packages and Eclipse 3.3 does not permit this.

I apologize for not having figured this out.\n\u003e In my defense, they are not where they were in Eclipse 3.2, and I am\n\u003e still confused as to what it is doing.\nIt appears that we fixed a bug in 3.3. In 3.2, the bug was that we incorrectly represented non-Java elements inside .jar files as packages, when they were correctly represented as folders if they were directories on disk.\n\n\u003e We are left with the problem of why is IsawHelp.Viewers.3D_view files\n\u003e treated differently from IsawHelp.Viewers.contour_view_files and the\n\u003e others.  In my opinion treating them as empty packages (white package\n\u003e symbols) is the better choice but I could argue either way.  In any\n\u003e event, there should be consistency.\nPlease see my answer above. I agree that there is little difference between these 2 names, but they are correctly represented as a non-Java element for \"3D_view\" and as a package for \"contour_view_files\".\n\n\u003e We are also left with the problem that setting the compliance to 1.4\n\u003e still does not allow org.apache.commons.lang.enum to be seen as a\n\u003e package or exported.  \nI suspect that you saw a bug: when the compliance is changed from 5.0 to 1.4, the Package explorer is not updated. But if you exit/restart Eclipse, you should now see \"org.apache.commons.lang.enum\" as a package. I entered bug 201244 for this problem.\n\n\u003e And there is no error indication that this is\n\u003e [only] because it has an invalid name in J2SE 1.5.  It otherwise\n\u003e qualifies to be shown and treated as a true package.  The former\n\u003e problem just leads to confusion.  This one prevents things that should\n\u003e be possible, for me as well as in the post by Scott.  And it hides the\n\u003e problem rather than making it apparent with an error or warning.\nYes, I agree that we should better report that a folder is excluded from the list of packages because it is not a valid package name.",
    "Jerome,\n\nThanks for your help.  Once one understands the rules, this issue does not appear to be a bug.  In spite of being confusing as well as different from before (perhaps some documentation would help) it is definitely an improvement over what was done in 3.2.  It is especially nice that it does not automatically export folders that are not packages any more or that have no classes (white package icon).\n\nI again apologize for not figuring this out myself.  I was overloaded with problems from converting to 3.3 and have been on travel much of the time since.  In addition, since the problem started for me because I got errors (with little useful information) in a previously working MANIFEST.MF, I probably approached the problem from the wrong perspective.\n\n\u003e\u003e I overwrote the old version with the current one. \n\u003e It is never recommended to unzip a version on top of another one. Instead, you\n\u003e should rename or delete the old sdk, and unzip the new one on a new directory.\n\nI agree.  I overwrote the previously downloaded ZIP file is all.  It may or may not have been the same.  However, it was a new install in a new directory.\n\nIn any event hopefully some good has come of this.\n\nThanks again,\n\n     -Ken\n\n\n",
    "No problem. I\u0027m moving this bug to DOC so that we document this issue next time we update the help."
