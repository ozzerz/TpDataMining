    "I\u0027m currently working with a few people on a SWT project where printing is needed. We are developing \nfor the MacOS X 10.3.3 platform. Currently we\u0027re having trouble in implementing swt printing in our \nproject. We then looked for some examples on swt printing and found this: http://dev.eclipse.org/\nviewcvs/index.cgi/~checkout~/platform-swt-home/snippits/snippet132.html?rev\u003d1.3\u0026content-\ntype\u003dtext/plain . We tried to run this on our target platform but were not successfull. What we get is \nthe following NullPointerException on stringExtent():\n\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.setString(GC.java:2033)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.textExtent(GC.java:2145)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.graphics.GC.stringExtent(GC.java:2085)\n\tat Main.main(Main.java:45)\n\n\nWe also tried to run the example without getExtent() and failed also with a NullPointerException on \ndrawString() . Are there any issues with GC on MacOS X? On a win32 machine everything worked fine. \nAre there any fixes for this? We are really pressed with this and would be glad if there was a bugfix or \nsome help with this issue. Also, would it be possible to use AWT printing in a SWT project?",
