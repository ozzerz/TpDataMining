    "As per dorian birsan, I am entering this bug. I have tried on several occasions\nand several ways to update my Eclipse version 3.0.0 to 3.0.1. In every case the\noutcome was the same, Eclipse will not run. I can make it run by deleting the\nconfiguration directory, but then it thinks it is still in version 3.0.0 and\ncontinues to ask me if I want to update. I also end up with both the 3.0.0 and\nthe 3.0.1 versions of the files being loaded and who knows what kind of problems\nthat will create.\n\nOne of the issue is that when I try to start it I get this in the error log:\n\n!SESSION Sep 21, 2004 15:37:31.225 ---------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dI200406251208\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_03\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi Sep 21, 2004 15:37:31.225\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.RuntimeException: No application id has been found.\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run(PlatformActivator.java:313)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:273)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.java:129)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n\tat sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:183)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:644)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:628)\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi Sep 21, 2004 15:37:31.241\n!MESSAGE Bundle update@/c:/Eclipse/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.compare_3.0.0/\n[7] was not resolved.\n\u003cSNIPPED for brevity\u003e\n\nthat indicates that the application id was not found. And this is in the\nconfig.ini file:\n\neclipse.buildId\u003dI200406251208\n\nwhich is the buildId for 3.0.0.\n\nI will be entering a seperate bug in Platform Update as per dorian birsan for\nthe rest of the issues.",
    "The companion bug is #74624.",
    "Updating the config.ini is not trivial since its content might have been \ncustomized by people shipping products on top of eclipse. Therefore if we were \nto override this file, serious problems would occur.\n\nThere is two possible solutions to this. One is to provide a special installer \nthat carefully add to the config.ini, and the other is for startup / osgi to \nbuild the configuration from several config.ini like files from the \nconfiguration folder. \n\nThis would ensure that the eclipse base can be updated without causing problems \nto other products.\n",
    "Um, you couldn\u0027t just read in the file, find the line that starts with\neclipse.buildId\u003d and just replace it with a new eclipse.buildId\u003d line then\nresave the file? How complicated does it need to be?",
    "I think build.id is just a particular case. I can describe a few scenarios in \nwhich osgi.bundles need to be update with the correct versions.\n\nNote that you are still running eclipse.exe, startup.jar, etc. from the \noriginal build, as they are not updated by the update manager. As a matter of \nfact, I don\u0027t see an easy way to update those.\n\nBack to build id: what happens if you decide to revert to a previous \nconfiguration (3.0.0 in this case)? Then you have to record the fact that you \nmade this change to config.ini, and revert the change as well. Currently only \nfeatures/plugins are being reverted to.\n\nThis is not to make the problem appear harder than it is (it should not be \nhard, as Ed said), but there is always something else that must be taken into \naccount. To me, the build id is the least worrisome of all these, and I would \nnot have in config.ini, but somewhere else (in a feature/plugin manifest, etc.)\n",
    "Moving to update."
