    "On preference page\nTeam - CVS - SSH2 Connection Method - Key Management\nthere are two buttons (\"Generate DSA Key...\" and \"Generate RSA Key...\") which both are creating an ssh key pair.\nWhen using without a password it all works fine, but using a passphrase doesn\u0027t.\n\nI used \"Save Private Key...\" (which stores both public and private key - should be renamed to \"Save Keys...\", but it\u0027s another feature request) to store the keys.\nI copied the public key to the server and tried to connect with the private key: the one without a password was working, the other one didn\u0027t.\n\nI verified this behaviour with the generated keys with normal ssh (cygwins openssh) and got the same results (without password: OK, with password: failed).\nIt failes for both DSA and RSA key generation.\n\nIt seems to be a problem with the passphrase protection algorithm on Team CVS SSH2 preference page.",

    "Still waiting for approval but that won;t happen in time for M7.",
    "0.1.31 is now in the latest integration builds. There\u0027s still a few things that need to happen before I can close the bug but for all intents and purposes, it is fixed.",
    "I have conformed that 0.1.31 is in the latest RC2 candidate build.",
    "Verified in I20070525-0010",
    "I spoke to soon. It looks like the Update manager doesn\u0027t like how the JAR was signed (see bug 189000). We\u0027ll need to pull the JAR for RC2 and address the signing problem for RC3.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d69074)\nThis plugin includes updated about.html and is singed by JCraft,Inc.\n\nThis is a response to the following message from Michael,\n\n\u003e I don\u0027t think that having the JSch JAR itself unsigned is a big deal since\n\u003e only the signing on the Runtime JAR is verified when Eclipse is launched.\n\u003e However, if you prefer that the JAR be signed, could you please add the\n\u003e new about.html, resign the JAR and attach it to bug 165432.\n\nI also think that unsigned jar is not a big deal, but users may worry about it.\n\nBy the way, I have one concern about including attached jar file in Eclipse SDK. Our certificate will expire at July 2008 and the problem may appear in \nthe future.  What happens if Eclipse finds the expired jar file? Will Eclipse\nreject to run?\n\n",
    "It was never a problem with Eclipse in general (i.e. Eclipse ran fine). The problem was that the Update Manager crashed when it encountered a JAR with an invalid signature. I suspect that the handling of a JAR with an expired signature would be a different code path (although I suspect it is a code path that has been equally poorly tested). I will check with the PMC to determine how they would like to proceed. My preference would be to use the signed JAR.\n\nOn a side note, is the expiration of the signature embedded in the signature itself or is this just a problem if JCraft does not renew it\u0027s signature?",
    "Can\u0027t we just explode the Jar and sign it with the Eclipse certificate?\nThat way we\u0027d verify that it\u0027s the authentic version distributed by Eclipse.org.\nJeff McAffer suggested such an approach at the Orbit newsgroup a while ago.",
    "I\u0027ve talked to Jeff and it turns out I was confusing \"conditioning of a JAR\" and \"signing of a JAR\". The statement is that we do not \"condition\" (i.e. PACK, etc.) JARs that we do not build ourselves. That does not mean we won\u0027t sign them but there is some uncertainty as to whether the current build infrastructure can support signing without conditioning. I will follow up with Kim to determine  whether signing without conditioning is possible.",
    "I\u0027m wondering how we could ever put anything on the Europa update site without conditioning it? The Europa site is packed by definition, as far as I know.\n\nThough it might not be an issue for Jsch, because it is part of the Platform runtime binary so it won\u0027t ever be retrieved from an update site, right?\n",
    "Yes, this it is possible to do this.  The change to exclude prebuilt bundles from packing and signing is in bug 187024 which I hope to release for RC3.",
