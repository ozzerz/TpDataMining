    "hi,\nI was using Eclipse (Version: 3.0.0, Build id: 200403100800) till yesterday.\nWhen I downloaded (Version: 3.0.0, Build id: 200403170800). I am running a\nWindows XP machine with the JDK 1.5.0 beta. My project though uses the JDK\n1.4.2_03 version to compile and the launch configs also uses the same 1.4.x JDK.\n\nIn the project classpath, I have the following jars in the classpath:\njce1_2_2.jar, sunjce_provider.jar (in that order) followed by the\norg.eclipse.jdt.launching.JRE_CONTAINER line. With the older (200403100800)\neclipse version, i am able to run fine, but with the later one, the launch is\nnot able to get to the javax.crypto.Cipher class (from the jce1_2_2 jar) and so\nour authentication mechanism fails.\n\nCould this be resolved easily?",
    "Move to JDT/Debug",
    "Needs investigation for M8.",
    "some more info: the jdk/jre installs that i use are just plain vanilla versions\n- ie none of the jars/java.policy/java.security files have been updated.",
    "But what is jce1_2_2.jar? It is not part of my JDK vanilla install? The \nsunjce_provider.jar will appear on the bootpath by default (as will all jars \nin the ext directory). Why are you adding them explicitly?",
    "Continue to investigate, but does not look like an M8 stop ship.",
    "What happens if you place the jars in the \u0027ext\u0027 directory of the JRE and the \nlaunch with nothing extra on your bootpath, but the \"JRE System Libaray\"?",
    "I tried that - but then i get some error message saying \"could not verify\ncertification\" (or something like that - sorry i dont have the exact message\nright now).\nBut, my question would be: why would this stop working if i just upgraded the\neclipse version? I was using the same JDK/JRE with the earlier version - and it\nworked fine).\nI also tried using the jars that are present in the JDK/JRE by not putting them\nin the project classpath (.classpath file) - and the whole thing works with both\nversions of eclipse, presumably because the jre container entry in the\n.classpath file has all the jars from the lib\\ext directory included in it.",
    "i just tried 3.0 M8 (with the vanilla version of the JDK/JRE), and got this:\nCaused by: java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: Cannot find any provider\nsupporting DESede\n\tat javax.crypto.Cipher.getInstance(DashoA6275)\n\ni will try the suggestion from comment \n\u003ca href\u003d\"https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d55287#c6\"\u003e#6\u003c/a\u003e",
    "ok - once i replaced all the jars in the JRE with the ones from my project lib,\ni get the following error:\nCaused by: java.lang.SecurityException: Cannot set up certs for trusted CAs:\njava.security.PrivilegedActionException: java.net.MalformedURLException: \nno protocol: US_export_policy.jar\n\tat javax.crypto.SunJCE_b.\u003cclinit\u003e(DashoA6275)\n",
    "sorry for bothering - but is there any progress on this bug? i am unable to move\nto any later builds due to this defect. If you require any config files (like\nthe .classpath and/or the .launch file), i would be happy to attach them to this bug",
    "is this in any way related to bug 56665?",
    "I don\u0027t know how to reproduce your problem. I\u0027m able to run the example from\nhttp://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/security/jce/JCERefGuide.html#Examples\nwithout problem.\nCan you provide a small test that shows the problem ?\n\nI don\u0027t understand why you add jce1_2_2.jar and sunjce_provider.jar to the build\npath/classpath. This 2 libraries are already part of the JRE (in 1.4.x).",
    "found the issue - my bad :-)\n\nthe issue was that the 4 jars that i mentioned, were such that 3 of them\noccurred before the JRe lib container, and the US_export_policy jar occurred\nAFTER the JRE library container. Also, since the jars that I had from my project\nwere signed using a different algorithm, the US export policy jar could not be\n\"accessed\".\n\nSo, now finally I can upgrade to M8!!! \nBut the question would still be: why did this work with the integration build\nthat i mentioned in my original bug comment?",
    "this works for me after i rearranged the project classpath."
