    "please review",
    "Great. Patch applied. Removed call to TaskListManager from TaskScheduleContentProvider\u0027s constructor since the manager isn\u0027t initialized yet. I like the addition of recalling previous presentation....nice.",
    "Thanks Rob. Is there anything left here?",
    "I think were good here. Perhaps documentation of the new extension point?",
    "BTW, what with that parsing reminders you\u0027ve removed?\n\nI\u0027ll update wiki on the weekend...",
    " (In reply to comment #7)\n\u003e BTW, what with that parsing reminders you\u0027ve removed?\nWas causing: \n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.tasks.ui.TaskListManager.parseFutureReminders(TaskListManager.java:277)\nat org.eclipse.mylyn.internal.tasks.ui.views.TaskScheduleContentProvider.\u003cinit\u003e(TaskScheduleContentProvider.java:83)\nat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\n\nIf removing this causes a regression we may need to be calling this upon setting dates.",
    "Right, but we should NOT have any hardcoded stuff outside of the presentation implementation. I am not sure what this parse thing does, but perhaps you can move that coll to some point in the presentation or in content provider when task list manager is already initialized.",
    " (In reply to comment #9)\n\u003e Right, but we should NOT have any hardcoded stuff outside of the presentation\n\u003e implementation. \n\nAgreed. \n\n\u003e I am not sure what this parse thing does, but perhaps you can\n\u003e move that coll to some point in the presentation or in content provider when\n\u003e task list manager is already initialized.\nDone.",
    " (In reply to comment #6)\n\u003e I think were good here. Perhaps documentation of the new extension point?\n\ndone. http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Integrator_Reference#Custom_presentations_for_the_Task_List_view",
    "The current implementation is causing the regression described on bug 200287.  Investigating...",
    "The problem here is that the extension point associates single content provider for each presentation.  However, task list content providers need to be coupled to an instance of a Task List view.  If there is more than one instance (e.g. two workbench windows) the content provider will break.  Investigating fix now...",
    "Need to re-implment the extension point as per comment#13...",
    "Most changes and tests now, complete, remaining work (and task context) will be on bug 200287.  I updated the documentation at:\n\n  http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Integrator_Reference#Adding_presentations_to_the_Task_List_view\n\nFyi, when we make this API for 3.0 I would like to remove the coupling to TaskListView and only couple to the viewer, added note to: http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn_Porting_Guide#Pending_Changes_for_Mylyn_3.0\n\nRob: in the future please review patches of this sort more carefully.  Thankfully this was caught by our multi-window unit tests, but we could have put out a build with a broken API and a regression for those who use multiple workbench Windows, which is a non-trivial number of users.  Also, ensure that changes of this magnitude include unit test coverage before applying.\n\nEugene: for changes of this magnitude, please first propose any API or extension point that you\u0027re planning on adding and provide additional test coverage of the key changes.  The general direction was good and it\u0027s great that you added docs, but this kind of change usually requires some design discussion to avoid inadvertently introducing this kind of problem.  "
