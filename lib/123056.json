    "this bug also is the same as reported by Bug 108436, 117708 and 79212. but obviously hasn\u0027t been resolved. perhaps the stack trace i provided will help.\n\nBTW, my machine is a newer machine (6 months old) running an Athlon X2 (dual-core) processor.\nWindows XP, SP2.  I have Windows Firewall turned OFF.\n\nThis problem happens every time i try to use Update Manager -- so it is very reproduceable.  Let me know if there\u0027s any other info needed (logs, etc.), or some tests I can try to help isolate the issue.\n\nWith Eclipse 3.2 nothing seems to get logged, but the problem still occurs. maybe i just haven\u0027t properly set log file path after upgrade to 3.2???\n\n",
    "I have had similar problems.  The following is from a post to\neclipse.newcomer made last Sunday.  I have three computers to update,\nand I was finally successful on one of them during the week.  The one\nthat is the subject of the newsgroup article, continued to fail this\nSaturday (today).  The only difference is that I got a list of mirror\nsites this time.  The first site updated at a steady .4 - .5 Mpbs,\nthen failed.  I could still use Eclipse after dismissing the dialog.\nThe second, never got any bytes, and I cancelled it.  (It got bytes in\nthe search part but not after I had Ok\u0027ed the license and began the\nactual download.  The search part has never failed.)  As before, the\ndialog did not go away, and I had to kill Eclipse to recover.  (I then\ncopied the installation from the one that had worked and did not try\nagain.)\n\nMy network has not been hung any of these times as far as I know.  I\nhave had NetsPerSec, a PC Magazine utility, running since the problems\nstarted.  And I do see traffic, though perhaps not after it has failed\nand before I have killed Eclipse.  I was not looking for that, and I\ncannot recall for sure so it may have been hung as described elsewhere\nin this bug.\n\nI had problems updating TaxCut this past week also.  They are probably\nbusier than the Eclipse update sites.  The difference is that each\ntime I restarted it, it continued from where it left off and\neventually succeeded.  Microsoft Updates also work this way, though I\nhave seldom had troubles with them.  They do not start over each time\nbut add to the bytes already downloaded.\n\nThere seem to be the following problems:\n\n1. It is not robust to network problems or busy remote sites.  I see\nno evidence of problems on my computers, and it sometimes works,\nespecially on shorter updates, such as CDT.\n\n2. It starts over each time.  This tends to make the entire system\nunstable: Update fails because of overload.  Trying again increases\noverload.  Update problems get worse.  Overload increases more yet,\n...\n\n3. The update dialog cannot be dismissed after cancellation.  I will\nsend a GIF of what it looks like after it has been cancelled.  There\nis no way to return to Eclipse.  The red stop icons in the several\nplaces they appear, seem to be independent of the others.  This is a\nbug.  Even if the rest of the system is flakey, Eclipse should\nrecover.  TaxCut timed out after a minute, for example.\n\nMy system is XP Pro and (was) Eclipse 3.1.1.  This computer is 1.8 Ghz\n(but the one on which I was successful is W2000 @ .8 GHz).  This one\nhas cable, which typically downloads at more than 2 Mbps.  The other\none is a company network that is typically slower than the cable for\ndownloads.)\n\n\u003d 2/19/2006 \u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\u003d\nI used  my whole day yesterday  trying to upgrade from  3.1.1 to 3.1.2\nvia the Update Manager on Windows XP.  See:\n\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/platform-releng/updatesfor3.1.1.html\n\nfor explicit directions.\n\n1.  It hung at various points in the download process, 12%, 40%, and\n60% being the most common.  At that point there were no bytes coming\nin, but no indication of any error in the Update Manager.  It sat\novernight at one of these points, 14%, the last time I tried.  It does\nnot recover.\n\n2. The Eclipse interface is frozen owing to the modal nature of the\nUpdate Manager dialog.  The dialog cannot be closed.  It indicates\nthat it responds to Cancel, or to the red square on the Details part\nof the dialog, or also the red square in the Progress view (all three\nseem to be independent of each other, though they should not be), but\nthere is never a way to close the dialog, and it does not go away by\nitself.\n\n3.  The Eclipse process has to be killed.  On doing that in Task\nManager, it says it cannot be closed because it is waiting for a user\nresponse.  There is no place I can see to make a response.  You have\nto kill Eclipse to get out of this.\n\n4.  The download is very slow.  It seems to come in sporadic bursts,\nwith peaks at about .5 Mbps (less than 1% in Task manager), but\naveraging much less.  The time between bursts varies greatly, eventually\nbecoming zero (at the hang).  I have a cable connection that typically\ndownloads at a steady 2 Mbps or more for comparison.\n\n5. There is no way to change the mirror site as described in the notes\nabove.  The problem is probably at the download site end, but Eclipse\nis not robust to that and the site cannot be changed.  No mirror site\ndialog appears as happens for other updates and in the instructions.\n\n6. I downloaded eclipse-SDK-3.1.2-win32.zip as a ZIP in 8 min at a\nsteady 2+ Mbps.  Thus, it does not seem to be a problem with my\nconnection or computer.  However, this was on one mirror site.  On\nanother it was slower and more sporadic, but still much faster than\nthe Update Manager dpownload, which took up to an hour or more before\nhanging.  (Why I spent all day.)\n\n7. I would like to use the Update Manager rather than reinstall from\nscratch and have to install all the other plug-ins again from their\nvarious sources.  That is what it is for.\n\n     I tried this on two computers, both running XP Pro.  It did the\nsame on both.  Both computers are working correctly on other\nprograms, and with Eclipse otherwise.\n\n     I later downloaded the CDT plugin via the Update manager, and it\nfailed once (after the files were apparently downloaded), then worked\nwith another site the next time.  The only difference that I can see\nis that it is not as large, and succeeds before things go south.\n\n     Finally, on a slightly different but related topic.  I would like\nto update VE via the Update Manager.  I believe it used to appear\nunder the default Eclipse.org update site item in the Update Manager,\nalong with GEF, etc. that it requires.  It does not now, and I don\u0027t\nsee any other directions on the VE site.  On the CDT site, there were\ndirections for another update site to visit, and they worked.\n\n     I have to do this for 3 computers, and I cannot even get it to\nwork on one.  It\u0027s not my favorite way to spend Saturday.  Any help\nwould be appreciated.  Thanks,\n\n-Ken\n\n\n",
