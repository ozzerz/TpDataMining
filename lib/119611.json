    "Created an attachment (id\u003d31429)\nRemoves unnecessary test\n\nthe test for the beginning of the debug line being missing was being applied twice. This should fix it. Note: my VM is acting a bit flaky, but this should solve the posted issue. ",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d31471)\nFixes non-removal of line number  from type name, and cropped 1st letter\n\nThe previous patch only fixed the issue with regards to a less recent batch of code. Since that point, the code change, which added an extra bug to this. \nThis patch works, removing the cropped 1st letter, as well as the new issue of not removing the line number from the type name. ;)",
