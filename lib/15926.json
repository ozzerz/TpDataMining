    "508\n\nUse a Sun JDK 1.4 to run the IDE, so your default JRE is 1.4.\n1. Import all of projects as binary.\n2. Define a Sun 1.3.1 JDK as an additional runtime.\n3. Set the Sun 1.3.1 JDK as the JRE to use for the Runtime-workbench.\nIn this configuration, I cannot get eclipse to launch.  Even without \nbreakpoints, I suspend at an IllegalArgumentException.  I get multiple\n\"not responding\" entries in the stack trace, and if I resume, I get the \nfollowing in the console.\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Application not found: \norg.eclipse.ui.workbench\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.boot.InternalBootLoader.run\n(InternalBootLoader.java:737)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.boot.BootLoader.run(BootLoader.java:420)\n\tat EclipseRuntimeLauncher.main(EclipseRuntimeLauncher.java:16)\nException in thread \"main\" \n\nIf I set my default VM to match my runtime VM (1.3.1 or 1.4) - this is \nthe standard behavior -I do not encounter this problem.",

    "PDE simply uses IVMRunner selected in the launcher to run the instance. Note \nthat you used JDK 1.4 to compile all your source in the workbench, but used \n1.3.1 to launch. Can this be a case of understandable lack of forward \ncompatibility (cannot run 1.4 code with 1.3.1)? I don\u0027t know how to fix the \nthis problem since choosing the rt.jar and otherwise launching the VM is \nhandled by the IVMRunner.\n\nDarin, can you comment the problem? Is there anything that PDE Launcher can do \nwrong in respect to choosing the IVMRunner to launch the workbench?",
    "I have not been able to reproduce this error. I have seen a problem when a \nbinary plug-in was compiled with 1.4 (unknowingly), and then failed to run with \n1.3. However, the test case does not indicate this.\n\nIn this case, since all plug-ins are binary, re-compiling is not an issue. I.e. \nif they were build with 1.3, then they remain as 1.3 even thought the workspace \nJRE is 1.4.\n\nJohn, can you reproduce this with a \"raw\" F2/or later build?",
    "Cannot reproduce this problem.  Please close.",
    "Closing."
