    "Using build 200605220100, when I execute a test on Windows I get the following exception :\n\norg.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.launch(TestExecutionHarnessExecutorStub.java)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.launchTestExecution(TestExecutionHarness.java)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness.access$2(TestExecutionHarness.java:1800)\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.harness.TestExecutionHarness$2.run(TestExecutionHarness.java:735)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\n\nNote:  This work OK on Linux. \n\nThis blocks me from running my tests for 4.2 Iteration 3 Test Pass 2.",
    "Updated priority to P1.\n\nIt looks like in ExecutorStub.waitForProcess() , it can never find the process it is looking for, times out and throws an InactiveProcessException.",
    "Mark has a fix in hand for this.  Don\u0027t spend time investigating.",
    "Fix checked in 4/24/06 at around 4 pm (EDT).",
    "ACTION: Please verify/close this defect.",
    "Closing by default since not closed by the originator in the 7+ months since being resolved.  \n\nPlease reopen if the issue is still present in the latest TPTP release or the resolution is not correct."
