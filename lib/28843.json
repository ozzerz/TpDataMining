    "Eclipse 2.0.2 ships with a version of externaltools.jar that seems to be out \nof sync with the Eclipse 2.0.2 source in CVS.\n\nIn particular, the file:\n  plugins\\org.eclipse.ui.externaltools_2.0.1\\externaltools.jar\n\nis part of the 2.0.2 release.  It contains the file AntFileRunner.class. This \nfile seems to correspond to the 2.0.1 version of AntFileRunner.java.\n\nAmong other things, this means that bug 23340 is not fixed in the 2.0.2 \nrelease.",
    "Using 2.0.2 I cannot reproduce the bug 23340 and along with the source \ncontained with the build, AntFileRunner is the correct version.\n\nDo you have a particular build file that causes a problem on 2.0.2?\n\nNote that it is unlikely that any fixes will occur in the 2.0.* stream.\nI would recommend checking out the 2.1 stream as the external tools / ant \nframework has been completely reworked.",
    "This seems to depend on how 2.0.2 is installed.\n\nIf I do a clean installation of 2.0.2, it works fine.\n\nIf I start with a clean installation of 2.0, I don\u0027t\nsee bug 23340 (since it was introduced in 2.0.1).\nIf I then select \"Help / Software Updates / New Updates\"\nfrom the eclipse menu, and upgrade to 2.0.2, I see\nbug 23340.  Here\u0027s the traceback I get:\n\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.externaltools.internal.core.AntFileRunner.execute\n(AntFileRunner.java:44)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.ui.externaltools.internal.core.DefaultRunnerContext.executeRunner\n(DefaultRunnerContext.java:413)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.externaltools.internal.core.DefaultRunnerContext.run\n(DefaultRunnerContext.java:439)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.ui.externaltools.internal.core.ExternalToolsBuilder.build\n(ExternalToolsBuilder.java:50)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager$2.run\n(BuildManager.java:392)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.run\n(InternalPlatform.java:839)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.run(Platform.java:416)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.basicBuild\n(BuildManager.java:120)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.basicBuild\n(BuildManager.java:176)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.basicBuild\n(BuildManager.java:186)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager$1.run\n(BuildManager.java:146)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.run\n(InternalPlatform.java:839)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.run(Platform.java:416)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.basicBuild\n(BuildManager.java:160)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.build\n(BuildManager.java:211)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.build\n(Workspace.java:142)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.actions.GlobalBuildAction$1.run\n(GlobalBuildAction.java:156)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run\n(ModalContext.java:98)\n\nThe ant file itself seems to be irrelevant, but I am specifying a\nworking directory of: ${project_loc}\n\nThis is on a Windows XP system.\n\nI haven\u0027t yet diffed the two installations to see what\u0027s different between\nthem.\n\n \n",
    "I was doing a clean install.",
    "Action Taken: Darin, do you mean that the 2.0.2 version of eclipse actually\nships an improper version of the JAR ? If so this is a releng issue (or build)\nIf it means Update Manager causes the issue, can you please elaborate ? TIA\nAction Plan: ping Darin",
    "I have verified that 2.0.2 ships with the correct JAR.\n\nIf one installs 2.0 and then uses the update manager (\"Help / Software \nUpdates / New Updates\") to update to 2.0.2 it is reported that the incorrect \nJAR is installed (it appears to be the 2.0.1 version). The JAR in question is \nnamed org.eclipse.ui.externaltools_2.0.1.\nAs I have been unable to download 2.0, I have not been able to verify the \nupdate problem report from maxhearn@aol.com.",
    "Action Taken: \nI have verified that\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/updates/features/org.eclipse.platform_2.0.2.jar\ncontains links to \n\n   \u003cplugin\n         id\u003d\"org.eclipse.ant.core\"\n         download-size\u003d\"0\"\n         install-size\u003d\"0\"\n         version\u003d\"2.0.1\"\u003e\n   \u003c/plugin\u003e\n\n\nand \n\n   \u003cplugin\n         id\u003d\"org.eclipse.ui.externaltools\"\n         download-size\u003d\"0\"\n         install-size\u003d\"0\"\n         version\u003d\"2.0.1\"\u003e\n   \u003c/plugin\u003e\n\nWhere is seems ANT team released version 2.0.2.\n\nThis means that updating to 2.0.2 using Update Manager will download Version\n2.0.1 of the plug-ins instead of 2.0.2.\n\nCan you change the Feature.xml in teh JAR ?\nAction Plan : Pass to releng\n",
    "The current state of externaltools.jar seems pretty confused to me.\n\nIf you download 2.0.2 directly, the file:\n  org.eclipse.ui.externaltools_2.0.1/externaltools.jar\ncontains a version of AntFileRunner.class that appears to correspond to the \n2.0.2 version of the source. Shouldn\u0027t this be in a file called\n  org.eclipse.ui.externaltools_2.0.2/externaltools.jar\n\nOn a related note, if you upgrade from 2.0 to 2.0.2, the file:\n  org.eclipse.ui.externaltools_2.0.1/externaltools.jar\ncontains a version of AntFileRunner.class that appears to correspond to the \n2.0.1 version of the source.  That\u0027s OK I think, but shouldn\u0027t there also be a \nfile called:\n  org.eclipse.ui.externaltools_2.0.2/externaltools.jar\nthat contains the 2.0.2 version?",
    "So this is what is going on.\n\nFor the 2.0.2 release the external tools team released a new version of source \ncode to the build but did not update their plugin.xml.\n\nThe result is a 2.0.1 \"version\" of the plugin was built with the new source \ncode.\n\nHowever, since the update site already contains a 2.0.1 plugin from version \n2.0.1, this is what you get when you attempt an upgrade.\n\nIt would appear the following is the correct course of action:\n\n    1) Fix the plugin.xml org.eclipse.ui.externaltools and rev the version to \n2.0.2\n    2)Update the org.eclipse.platform-feature to rev the plugin version for \nexternaltools.\n    3)Rebuild 2.0.2\n    4) Replace the download on eclipse.org drops page with new 2.0.2.  \nEssentially same drop but the externaltools plugin will now be labeled \ncorrectly as 2.0.2\n    5) Put the new feauture and plugin jars on the update site.\n\nThis will fix new people that download 2.0.2 directly *and* new people that \nupgrade 2.0.1 to 2.0.2.  However, I think people that have already used the \nupdate site to go to 2.0.2 are still broken.\n\nI don\u0027t see any way of fixing the people that have already used update manager \nto go to 2.0.2 ... unless we issue a 2.0.3 build which is not something I \nterribly keen on doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe external Tools folks released a new version of source code that got built \ninto the jar.  However, sine they did not update their plugin.xml to a 2.0.2 \nversion this new jar got built into the 2.0.1 plugin.\n\n",
    "2.0.2 is already done and rebuilding it is not an option. An official fix for \nthis will have to be part of 2.0.3.\n\nFor now, steps to workaround the problem need to be communicated.",
    "Closing given the availability of newer releases."
