    "Hi, \n\nI\u0027ve tried AspectjforJbuilder 1.1b2. I can compile but I can\u0027t run the program\nI use Jbuilder 6.0. When running, I get this message :  \njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError\n\tat logger.LoggerTest.main(LoggerTest.java:34)\nException in thread \"main\" \n\nI know it looks like the message in the doc AjdeForJBuilder.html but I\u0027ve added \nAspectJ Runtime to the libraies of the project and to the libraries of JBuilder\n\nCan someone help ?\n\nthanks for your answer",
    "It looks like a class that you defined (logger.LoggerTest.main) is not on your \nclasspath when you\u0027re running.  Try making sure that it is a library for your \nproject (if it is found in a JAR).  If it is in the source of your project \nmake sure that your source root is set up propertly.\n\nIf it still does not work you can reopen this report with a description of \nyour project setup.  \n\nBut please note that AspectJ 1.0.6 is the last supported version that worked \nwith JBuilder 6, but that version will not be seeing more bug fixes.  The \nlatest 1.1.1 version works on JBuilder 9."
