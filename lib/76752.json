    "In one of our customer\u0027s sources, she is highlighting a procedure name\nand selecting \"Open Declartion\".  This causes a new editor to open with the\nsame file in it.  Now, there are two editors displaying the same file.\nHowever, hovering over the tab shows the original file at location:\n   \n    UserInterfaceView/blah/blah/blah.c  (a linked resource path)\n\nAnd the second editor shows the location:\n\n    M:/network_drive/view/blah/blah/blah.c  (the actual location)\n\nNow, add on top of this, if she again selects \"Open Declaration\", but on\nthe second editor\u0027s file, an error occurs:\n    java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException\n    at org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext.run(ModalContext.java:284)\n    at org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.ProgressMonitorDialog.run\n(ProgressMonitorDialog.java:397)\n    at org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.search.actions.OpenDeclarationsAction.run\n(OpenDeclarationsAction.java:200)\n    .\n    .\n    .\nThe place I can find it going bad is:\n\n    OpenDeclarationActions.class (CDT 2.0.2) line #153:\n\n    IFile resourceFile \u003d fEditor.getInputFile();\n\nThis returns null.\n\nThis seems to be a side-effect of using linked-resources.",
    "I think this is fixed in CVS HEAD.\n\nCan you give me a specific example of how I can reproduce this to check?",
    "At the time of this problem, the project was setup such that all the contents \nwere in a single linked resource utilizing a linked resource variable:\n\nProject\\\n   Stuff (linked res -\u003e \\MY_VARIABLE\\stuff)\\\n      src\\\n      build\\\n      inc\\\n      lib\\\n\nMY_VARIABLE -\u003e \\\\network_location\\blah\\blah\n\nWorking on source files in this linked resource would show the open \ndeclaration problem.\n\n",
    "This should be fixed once 92915 is fixed.",
    "FIXED in HEAD.  Please verify."
