When I launch this report in web-based viewer (/birt/frameset?__report\u003d) report is working, but when I launch it as standalone HTML (/birt/run?__report\u003d) the viewer return exception: \n\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Stream closed\n    at org.eclipse.birt.report.data.oda.xml.util.SaxParser.run(SaxParser.java:108)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:534)",
    "Which BIRT version you are using? Please attach your design file.",
    "I am using own build (28 Feb), but I tested my report with 2.1RC0 this morning. I observed that frequency this kind of exceptions is proportional to system-rate and generate XML?s by servlet time.",
    "Please attach your design file. We need more information to know where the problem is.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d38896)\nExample BIRT design file\n\n",
    "XML driver may try to access one InputStream from two or more different threads, and both threads will move the pointer in the stream.Now we cache the InputStream to a file, then every threads will create their own InputStream from file. The problem is so that fixed.",

    "Verified in daily build 20060516. Fixed."
