    "Some more details:\n\n - I have had this same workspace running since yesterday, but the problem only started happening today.\n\n - It seems to be complaining about org.eclipse.equinox.examples.registry_1.0.0.200703210940.jar. This is in project \"equinox\" in repo /cvsroot/org.eclipse at path /www/equinox.  This project has no outgoing changes in my workspace",

There might be something wrong with the file in the repository, or maybe something went wrong while committing the file...",
    "I actually didn\u0027t have any change on this file, either incoming or outgoing. Unfortunately after a restart the problem is no longer reproducible. Feel free to close as INVALID since I can\u0027t reproduce it."
