    "When shutting down the eclipse platform with autorefresh (and native support \nusing com.example.autorefresh.win32_2.0.0_20021007) plugins installed, the \nfollowing null pointer exception may happen:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat com.example.autorefresh.AutoRefreshPlugin.monitorFailed\n(AutoRefreshPlugin.java:402)\n\tat com.example.autorefresh.win32.internal.Win32Monitor.run\n(Win32Monitor.java:107)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:536)\n\nThe problem seems to be a race condition in AutoRefreshPlugin shutdown: the \nfMonitorManager may be nulled before all monitor threads have terminated.\n\nThe problem i.e. does not occur in debug mode.\n\nI\u0027ve found out that the specific error of the WAIT_FAILED signal which is \nattempted to be reported Win32Monitor.run is 6 (invalid handle). \n\nMaybe we shoud wait until all monitor threads have been terminated (i.e. using \nThread.join) before setting fMonitorManager to null.\n\nside note: although both Win32Monitor.removePath and getHandles are both \nsynchronized, once run has obtained the handles, they could be used while \nanother thread invalidates them. However I don\u0027t think this is the cause for \nthe problem described.",
