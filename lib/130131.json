    "I\u0027m using eclipse 3.2 (eclipse-platform-3.2M4-linux-gtk.zip) with TPTP 4.2 and I cannot create an analysis configuration on Linux RH4.\n\nTo reproduce, switch to Java perspective. Select Run-\u003eAnalysis... Then in the configuration dialog, select Analysis and click New. Then the errors occur.\n\nFirst, an SWT error: No more handles [MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME] not set. I\u0027m using RH4 which has firefox by default, not mozilla, so I did \"export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME\u003d/usr/lib/firefox-1.0.7/\". Now I\u0027m getting \"Problems occurred while invoking code from org.eclipse.jface (IllegalArgExc, arg cannot be null at SWT.error)\".\nSee the attached errors in screenshots.",

    "org.eclipse.tptp.platform.analysis.core.ui.internal.launch.ProviderTab.loadRuleTemplates(ProviderTab.java:163) is trying to add a null item string to a Combo, which is not a valid thing to do.\n\nReassigning to tptp.  I don\u0027t know if the component and version are correct; Tanya if they aren\u0027t then please update them, thanks.\n",
    "To my knowledge all version of RedHat include Mazilla - even if the browser used by the user is FireFox.  You do need to set the Mozilla home directory so Eclipse can run properly.\n\n\nIn any case this problem has nothing to do with Analysis.  Try open the Eclipse Help which uses the same browser control.",
    "I don\u0027t think that Mozilla is the real issue here.  There\u0027s an IllegalArgumentException being thrown because a null argument is being passed by org.eclipse.tptp.platform.analysis.core.ui.internal.launch.ProviderTab to Combo.add(...) in the Mozilla _working_ case.  It\u0027s quite likely that this error would still happen on any other linux (or even win32) installation for which Mozilla was not an issue.\n\nThe relevant error is the very last entry in the comment 2 attachment.  If ProviderTab does not live within the Platform.Analysis component then I\u0027ve moved this report to the wrong place; please reopen it and pass it along to the correct component, TIA.\n",

    "This is the right component, if it\u0027s not SWT.\nI\u0027ve corrected a couple variables, and the error is different now, but still an SWT error invoked from Analysis Provider. \nI had my MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME path set wrong; it should be set to the bin directory containing the executable, eg /usr/bin (where my firefox exe is).\nAlso LD_LIBRARY_PATH should be the variable that points to the lib containing xpcom.so: /usr/lib/firefox-1.0.7. Note that my LD_LIBRARY_PATH also points to the folder containing libcairo.so.2.2.3.\n\nThe error now is \norg.eclipse.swt.SWTError: XPCOM error -2147221164\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.error(Browser.java:1063)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.browser.Browser.\u003cinit\u003e(Browser.java:174)\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.platform.analysis.core.ui.details.HtmlDetailProvider.initializeDetails(HtmlDetailProvider.java:43)\n\tat org.eclipse.tptp.platform.analysis.core.ui.internal.launch.ConfigurationComposite.\u003cinit\u003e(ConfigurationComposite.java:93)\n\n\n(see attachment for the rest)\n ",
    "That\u0027s not right either, MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME should be\nthe location of an embeddable mozilla install (/usr/lib/firefox-1.0.7\nmay be embeddable on your machine).  If you\u0027re using the \"eclipse\"\nexecutable, it will add the MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME location to your\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH for you (needed to dlopen libxpcom.so).\n\nXPCOM errors like that may be bugs in the Mozilla integration\nin SWT.",
