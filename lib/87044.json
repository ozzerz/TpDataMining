    "While exploring, I clicked on the CVS tab in preferences, and\nseem to have damaged my environment.  I do have CVS, but I wasn\u0027t\nreally planning to introduce eclipse to it yet.   I have a blank\ncvs repository in the preferences, but something thinks it is \nenabled.   My first symptom was a complaint about badly formatted\nrepository tag after modifying a file, but now, after exiting \neclipse and restarting, I get a blank window with no projects.\n\nHere is some junk for .log which may be diagnostic:\n\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_06\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nCommand-line arguments:  -data G:\\share\\projects\\eclipse -os win32 -ws win32\n-arch x86\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 0 2005-03-02 20:59:58.953\n!MESSAGE Invalid CVS repository location format: :local:f:\\cvs\\ddyer\n!STACK 1\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.CVSException: Invalid CVS repository\nlocation format: :local:f:\\cvs\\ddyer\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.connection.CVSRepositoryLocation.fromString(CVSRepositoryLocation.java:254)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.util.KnownRepositories.getRepository(KnownRepositories.java:167)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.util.KnownRepositories.getRepositoriesFromProjects(KnownRepositories.java:231)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.util.KnownRepositories.getRepositoriesMap(KnownRepositories.java:209)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.util.KnownRepositories.internalGetRepository(KnownRepositories.java:173)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.core.util.KnownRepositories.getRepository(KnownRepositories.java:165)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSLightweightDecorator.extractContainerProperties(CVSLightweightDecorator.java:237)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSLightweightDecorator.decorate(CVSLightweightDecorator.java:228)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.CVSLightweightDecorator.decorate(CVSLightweightDecorator.java:166)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.ui.internal.decorators.LightweightDecoratorDefinition.decorate(LightweightDecoratorDefinition.java:220)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.ui.internal.decorators.LightweightDecoratorManager$LightweightRunnable.run(LightweightDecoratorManager.java:65)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.InternalPlatform.run(InternalPlatform.java:1015)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Platform.run(Platform.java:757)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.ui.internal.decorators.LightweightDecoratorManager.decorate(LightweightDecoratorManager.java:287)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.ui.internal.decorators.LightweightDecoratorManager.getDecorations(LightweightDecoratorManager.java:273)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.ui.internal.decorators.DecorationScheduler$2.run(DecorationScheduler.java:317)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:67)\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 4 2005-03-02 20:59:58.953\n!MESSAGE Invalid CVS repository location format: :local:f:\\cvs\\ddyer\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 4 2005-03-02 20:59:58.953\n!MESSAGE Location must have form\n\u0027:methodname:[user[:password]@]host:[port]/path/to/cvsroot\u0027\n!SUBENTRY 2 org.eclipse.team.cvs.core 4 4 2005-03-02 20:59:58.953\n!MESSAGE Only the following methods are supported: extssh, pserver, ext",
    "this seems to leave me completely dead in the water.  I can\u0027t open\nmy workspace and I can\u0027t find anything to turn the **\u0026!* cvs stuff\noff!\n",
    "I can\u0027t imagine how an exception in a decorator is bringing down your workbench.\n This is very troubling.",
    "\nIt turns out, it didn\u0027t bring down the whole workbench, it just\nleft things in a state which confused me.  The \"welcome\" window\nwas covering everything.  While flailing around I closed it, and\nthe rest of the environment reappared.\n\nIt is still the case that this error occurs every time I start,\nand a pop-up complaining about misconfigured CVS appears every time\nI save a file.  Very annoying, but at least not fatal.\n\nThe real problems (aside from my confusion) are that there seems to be\nno way to turn off this unwanted attempt to integrate my exlipse\nproject with cvs, and (separately) no way to make it work correctly.\n",
    "We turn off failed decorators but I know there is CVS code that turns them on\nagain in certain circumstances. We need to see if there is some vicous cycle\nbeing created here.",
    "CVS will only turn on the decorators the first time the CVS UI Plugin starts. \nWhen this happens, a preference is set to indicate that the decorators should \nnever be turned on automatically again. \n\nFrom the trace, I don\u0027t see how this exception could be doing any harm. \nCVSException is a caught exception and only a runtime exception can be \npropogated to the decoration manager.",
    "I agree that the decorator exception is non the major source\nof my complaint.  The problem is that the CVS repository path\nis nonfunctional, so all attempts to intereact with the repository\nfail.  This results in error pop-ups every time I save a file.\n\nI finally managed to turn off CVS for the project, but it was not\nat all an obvious thing.  A first-order fix should be an option\nON THE ERROR POP-UP to turn off CVS for the affected project.\n\nAlso, initially, there were NO cvs paths, but eclipse was trying to\nuse CVS anyway, and of course failing.  I made several attempts to\nadd working paths, but failed to find the magic combination.  I could\nnot even DELETE the nonworking paths I had added.  An I haven\u0027t been \nable to turn on logging to get a detailed explanation why the CVS paths\nare not working.",
    "I think this is a dup of bug 84689.",
    "auto-sharing may explain how CVS got activated in the first place.\nIt doesn\u0027t account for why I can\u0027t remove invalid roots, or why\neclipse misbehaves if the root is invalid.\n",
    "Yup. I\u0027ll have a look at these issues when I address bug 84689.",
    "I have fixed the auto-sharing problem. This prevents projects with invalid \nroots from being shared and thus, the other witnessd behavior should not occur.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 84689 ***"
