    "I recall entering this bug a long time ago but I don\u0027t know where it is now and\nthat was an older version of Eclipse;  Probably 3.1m something.  In any event,\nits back with a vengence!\n\nI can no longer develop.  Somehow Eclipse refuses to let go of old plugins\nlaunched and now when I try to launch a runtime workbench it crashes and\ncomplains about not finding plugins A and plugins B, both of which are closed\nprojects that are not referenced in any way by the plugins in the workspace\ncurrently.\n\nI also tried to create a new launcher configuration but even then if somehow\nfinds the data!?!  I use linked output folders but I checked and they are not\nlinked to the same place (which is a mistake i made once before)\n\nHow does it know about plugins that are in CLOSED projects??\nI am utterly baffled.  This is my error\n\n!SESSION 2005-10-10 19:26:03.907 -----------------------------------------------\neclipse.buildId\u003dunknown\njava.version\u003d1.4.2_09\njava.vendor\u003dSun Microsystems Inc.\nBootLoader constants: OS\u003dwin32, ARCH\u003dx86, WS\u003dwin32, NL\u003den_US\nFramework arguments:  -application com.rigidsoftware.wad.application -pdelaunch\nCommand-line arguments:  -application com.rigidsoftware.wad.application -data\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\dnoyeb\\runtime-WAD2 -dev file:C:/Documents and\nSettings/dnoyeb/workspace/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/Wad\nAssert/dev.properties -pdelaunch -consoleLog -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.858\n!MESSAGE Bundle initial@reference:file:G:/EclipseProjects/WAD_JETDS/ [1] was not\nresolved.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.858\n!MESSAGE Missing host com.rigidsoftware.wad_0.0.0.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.858\n!MESSAGE Missing required bundle com.rgdsft.business_0.0.0.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.868\n!MESSAGE Missing required bundle com.rigidsoftware.wad.jetds_core_0.0.0.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.878\n!MESSAGE Bundle initial@reference:file:G:/EclipseProjects/WAD2_DS_AccessDB/ [2]\nwas not resolved.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.878\n!MESSAGE Missing required bundle com.rgdsft.wad_0.0.0.\n!SUBENTRY 1 org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.878\n!MESSAGE Missing required bundle com.rgdsft.business_0.0.0.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-10-10 19:26:04.878\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Application \"com.rigidsoftware.wad.application\"\ncould not be found in the registry.

    "This is so embarrasing.  It bug #83763 all over again.  Which is not a bug at\nall :(  I knew this was so familiar.\n\nThis time though since my old flash drive is still good, this is a problem with\nthe flash drive itself.  It can\u0027t differentiate properly between stuff that\nstarts with the same letters then an \u0027_\u0027 ocassionally.\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 83763 ***",
    "Let me hold this open for a week at least to entertain how this is even possible?\n\nDirectories\n\nG:\\WAD\nG:\\WAD_JETDS\n\nSomehow when eclipse goes to launch, instead of loading from directory WAD which\nhas the project, it gets its data from WAD_JETDS which is a different project. \nI think there must be a directory that has the same name as what appears to the\nleft of the underscore for this error to occur.\n\nThat is the sum of this problem.  No it does not happen when I copy the same\nfiles to the harddrive.  No I do not think the flash drive is wearing out.  This\ndoes not affect my development, or display of the folders.  So I can open the\nprojects and edit them just fine with no problems saving or loading or listing\nfiles.  It only occurs during PDE launch.  Which if you think about it makes\nabsolutely no sense at all.",
    "Any tips on what source I should investigate to find the root cause of this\nissue, or blame it on the JVM/OS?  Is the source I need to check part of the\nEclipse SDK, or do I need to download something?\n\nAlso, what is different about how the launching mechanism finds the project\u0027s\nfolders to add to the runtime workspace, versus how the PDE environment finds\nthe projects for editing.  I have been using and editing and compiling for about\n2 weeks with no problem.  As soon as I try to launch it gets mixed up.  So I\nwant to isolate this difference.\n\nNote: My projects all use linked output folders which are always on my harddrive.\n\n\nTo explain the log a bit more\nfolder               plugin\nWAD                  com.rigidsoftware.wad\nWAD_JETDS            cant remember\nWAD2_DS_AccessDB     com.rigidsoftware.wad.jetds_core\n\nThe project names don\u0027t have \u0027_\u0027 in them nor do the plugin ids.  its only the\nfolders the projects are in.  In reading bug #83763 again, I think this could\nhave something to do with the order the folders are returned in.  When I copy to\nthe harddrive the order is chanded.  Any tips would be helpful;  in the meantime\nI\u0027ll dig deeper.",
    "I gave up on this.  I don\u0027t use linked output folders anymore.  No longer investigating.  Another time..."
