    "I had this appear in the console I lauched eclipse from. No log so I can\u0027t\nreally say what I was doing at the time.\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:77)",
    "This can occur if a Job returns null as a result. We need to protect against it,\nor  log a more detailed exception if a job returns null. The spec of Job.run\nshould be updated to say a job must never return null. After doing a code\nreview, I see that \nDelayedSnapshotJob can return null in failure cases.\n\nCC DJ for RC2 fix approval (at least protect against the NPE)",
    "Should fix for RC2.",
    "Fixed. Three changes:\n\nDelayedSnapshotRunnable.run - result was initially assigned to null, but further\nanalysis showed that all code paths eventually assigned a value. To make it\nclearer, I initially assigned the result to Status.OK_STATUS. This has no\neffect, but makes it clear that it cannot return null.\n\nWorker.run - handle NullPointerException more elegantly and log it.\n\nThere may still be a job out there that returns a null result, but it will now\nbe logging this case rather than just dying."
