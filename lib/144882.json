    "I have a separate source folder for XML files. If I select a XML file in it, and \"Mark as Mylar Landmark\", it doesn\u0027t show up in Package Explorer when I choose \"Apply Mylar\". If I un-apply Mylar, then ask to mark the source folder as a Landmark, Mylar complains that the source folder it\u0027s not a valid landmark, but now, the XML file will show up when Mylar is applied.\n\nI\u0027m using Callisto RC3 (including WTP) and Mylar 0.5.2.",

Yes, the XML file is located in a Java source folder which contains only XML files.\n",
    "I still can\u0027t reproduce (i.e. I\u0027m able to make a build.xml file a landmark both in an src folder and in a Java package within such a folder.  But I recall a similar complaint and so would like to get to the bottom of this.  Could you either attach a screenshot, or write out the relevant part of the project project/folder/file structure, indicating which types/icons each resources is?\n\nBy \"clear a context\" I meant to right-click the task and select \"Clear Context\".  But you don\u0027t actually need to do that--creating and activating a new task should suffice.",

    "Thanks Daniel.  Which XML editor are you using?  If you open that file up with a plain text editor does that show up?\n\nIf not, if you put a .java file next to the XML file and open it does that work?\n\n",
    "I\u0027m using the WTP XML editor. After opening it with the \"Text Editor\", it still doesn\u0027t show up.\nThis folder didn\u0027t have any .java files, so I copied a .java file to this folder, and after opening the .java file it (XML file) does show up.\n\nI tried clearing the context, then opening the Java file with the Text Editor, then applying Mylar, and the Java file didn\u0027t show up either; but as I retried this, sometimes it would show up, and sometimes not. This behaviour is pretty erratic, I didn\u0027t manage to isolate what works and what doesn\u0027t.\n\nIt seems that it has more to do with the Editor type than with the filetype. ",

    "1) Unapply Mylar Filter in Package Explorer\n2) Create a new Dynamic Web Project\n3) Click Finish\n4) Open Mylar Task List\n5) Create new Mylar Task\n6) Activate just-created Mylar Task\n7) Create new File (File | New | File) named test.xml under the project\u0027s src/ directory\n8) test.xml just created file is automatically opened\n9) Apply Mylar Filter in Package Explorer\n10) test.xml is not shown in Package Explorer\n11) Close test.xml editor\n12) Open file using Navigate | Open Resource | test.xml\n13) test.xml is not shown in Package Explorer\n\nThis is the simplest way I found to reproduce this behaviour. It happens both when the editor is automatically opened after creating the file, and when the file is manually opened via Open Resource.\n\nHope this helps; if you need any more info, please let me know.\n\nI\u0027m using the Callisto RC4a and Mylar 0.5.3",
