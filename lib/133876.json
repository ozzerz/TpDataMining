    "Using build I20060329-0010, I got an NPE which messages starts with: \neclipse.buildId\u003dI20060118-0800\n\nThis is the case in the Session Data panel of the Event Details dialog, and in the exported log as well. Interestingly enough, other errors of today in the same eclipse show the appropriate build id, including one that is another instance of the same error. I will attach the complete log for reference.",

    "I still see this from time to time, also with different buildIds for entries logged during the same Eclipse session.\n\nCould be a problem with .log file rotation. I\u0027m running I20070123-1715, and below are the two most recent entries from the Error Log view.

    "The build id is only logged when we write a !SESSION entry.  This should only be done on the very first log entry for the session and once for each time we rotate a log.  Each time we write the !SESSION entry we simply get the configuration property eclipse.buildId to write the build id to the log.  The only way this could change in the rotated log is if the config property changed since the last time we saved a !SESSION entry.\n\nA log file may contain multiple sessions that use different builds.  In that case each session will record the different build id used.  It seems like this is the case in the attached log.\n",
