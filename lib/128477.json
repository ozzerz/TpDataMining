    "It looks like the chart model contains an unregonized character.  I am wondering if the reports where generated for a different language other than english on your machine.  \n\nCan you trying generating a \"XML Test Report\" instead.  Make sure you specify a time interval.  Try a start time of \u002702/24/2003 05:13:03 PM\u0027 and an end time of \u002702/24/2006 05:13:03 PM\u0027\n\nCould you post the xml file that is produced.",

    "I was able to reproduce the problem with IBM jdk 1.5.  The problem is that the chart.xsd file contains an invalid attribute.  I guess the xml validator shipped in IBM jdk 1.5 is different than the SUN jdk 1.5.  I will check in this fix when 4.2i1 is done.",
