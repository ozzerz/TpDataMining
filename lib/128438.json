    "I have been running Eclipse 3.1.2 for a few weeks before I suddently started getting the following error when I start the application:\n\n!SESSION Fri Feb 17 09:29:15 MST 2006 ------------------------------------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.launcher 4 0 2006-02-17 09:29:15.265\n!MESSAGE Exception launching the Eclipse Platform:\n!STACK\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not find framework\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.getBootPath(Main.java:635)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:272)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:973)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:948)\n\nI am running Eclipse on a Pentium IV 3.2 Ghz, 1gb Ram, and Windows XP Pro SP2.\n\nI ran \"java.exe -jar startup.jar -debug\" and got what I think is an unusual result, listed below: \n\nC:\\eclipse\u003ejava -jar startup.jar -debug\nInstall location:\n    file:/c:/Program Files/Java/jre1.5.0_04/lib/ext/\nConfiguration file:\n    file:/c:/Program Files/Java/jre1.5.0_04/lib/ext/configuration/config.ini not\n found or not read\nConfiguration location:\n    file:/c:/Program Files/Java/jre1.5.0_04/lib/ext/configuration/\nConfiguration file:\n    file:/c:/Program Files/Java/jre1.5.0_04/lib/ext/configuration/config.ini not\n found or not read\n\nThe first thing I noticed is that it is attempting to read the config.ini from the JAVA_HOME directory.  \n\nI have tried everything I can think of (altered by system environments, etc) to make Eclipse look in the right folder for the config.ini, but have failed.  Admittedly, I am fairly new to Java so I\u0027m not sure what else to check.  Google and Eclipse newsgroup searches have not provided me with any suitable resolution yet.  \n\nPlease help!",
    "That\u0027s strange.  It is not finding the eclipse install location. Here is a more typical output:\n\nInstall location:\n    file:/d:/eclipse/\nConfiguration file:\n    file:/d:/eclipse/configuration/config.ini loaded\nConfiguration location:\n    file:/d:/eclipse/configuration/\nFramework located:\n    file:/d:/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.osgi_3.2.100.v20060814.jar\n\nCan you still reproduce? Can you reproduce on a fresh install of Eclipse?",
    "Closing. Please re-open if you can provide the required information. Thanks."
