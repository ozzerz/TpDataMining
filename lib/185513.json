    "Build ID: M20060118-1600\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nWe have applied some latest Office2003 Hot fixes(more details in the MORE INFORMATION section)to some of our machines in our company.

Unzip the attached file( in C:\\Outlook)\n2. C:\\Outlook\u003ejavac.exe -classpath swt.jar -d . *.java\n3. C:\\Outlook\u003eset PATH\u003d.;%PATH%\n4. C:\\Outlook\u003ejava -cp swt.jar;. TestOutlook\n\nMore information:\nExact Error thrown is:\nException in thread \"main\" org.eclipse.swt.SWTException: Action can not be performed. result \u003d 1\n        at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OLE.error(OLE.java:342)\n        at org.eclipse.swt.ole.win32.OleAutomation.invokeNoReply(OleAutomation.java:497)\n        at arch.swing.ole.OleFactory$OleHandler.invoke(OleFactory.java:70)\n        at $Proxy1.display(Unknown Source)\n        at TestOutlook.main(TestOutlook.java:17)\n\nThe source code and Hot Fixes are attached.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d65896)\nThe Source Code\n\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d65898)\nIt contains the list of Office2003HotFixes which are applied to machines on which the SWT error occurs\n\nThe Error explained would not occur on normal machines. Only the machines having the Patches/Hot Fixes mentioned in this XL file would throw this exception.",
    "This issue is affecting one of our important releases.\nPlease get back to me if in case you need any more information.\n\nThanks,\nSumeet",
    "This doesn\u0027t seem to be related to Eclipse webtools. \n\nJohn, can you move this one to Platform/swt.",
    "Duong, please try hard to help these guys.  Recreate their problem and find me.  NOTE: They are shipping soon.",
    "We currently don\u0027t have Office2003. I\u0027ve ordered a copy but it\u0027ll take a few days to get here."
