    "After 3.2 official delivery I wanted to put our 3.2.1 work released in TARGET_321 branch in maintenance branch R3_2_maintenance.\n\nMerge was done rapidly as this was a simple overwrite of all files modified in TARGET_321.\n\nThen, I tried to commit all changes. I selected all JDT/Core projects (6 items) and  then click on \u0027Commit...\u0027 menu item and get following NPE:\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.team.ui 4 0 2006-07-01 20:04:11.901\n!MESSAGE Internal error occurred.\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n        at org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.mapping.ResourceModelParticipantAction.getTraversals(ResourceModelParticipantAction.java:116)\n        at org.eclipse.team.internal.ui.mapping.ResourceModelParticipantAction.getResourceTraversals(ResourceModelParticipantAction.java:51)\n        at org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.mappings.CommitAction.access$0(CommitAction.java:1)\n        at org.eclipse.team.internal.ccvs.ui.mappings.CommitAction$1.run(CommitAction.java:78)\n        at org.eclipse.jface.operation.ModalContext$ModalContextThread.run(ModalContext.java:113)\n\nThis is a severe error as I cannot commit my changes (176) and do not figure out how I can do it...\n\nBuild I used was M20060629-1905 but it also happens using build I20060602-1317...",
    "Size down severity as I cannot reproduce this problem in a fresh new workspace where I checked-out all JDT/Core projects and merged branches...",
    "\n\n*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 146833 ***",
    "Is this really a duplicate? NPE does not happen at the same location...",
    "It is another instance of the same problem and the fix applies to both cases (i.e. a get method that used to return null but has been fixed to always return a value).",
    "OK, that was just be sure...\nThanks."
