    "For example, following the \"Creating an Eclipse plug-in\" cheat sheet from Eclipse 3.2, when I click the \"Launch an Eclipse application\" link, I have this error:\n\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Application \"org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench\"\ncould not be found in the registry.

    "we need more information.\n\nwhat is your target platform location as specified on the Plug-in Development \u003e Target Platform preference page?\n\nwhat plug-ins does that location contain?  all the sdk plug-ins?\n\n",
    "The target platform location is C:\\eclipse_target which contains the RCP SDK unzipped and unmodified from eclipse-RCP-SDK-3.2-win32.zip.\nIt contains 23 plug-ins.\nIf I change the target platform to Eclipse SDK, the tutorial works. However, as it\u0027s recommended to reconfigure the target, I believe it should also work with RCP target.",
    "what tutorial?",
    "re comment 3, nm.  you\u0027re referring to the \u0027Creating an Eclipse plug-in\u0027 cheatsheet.\n\n\u003eHowever, as it\u0027s recommended to reconfigure the target, I believe it should \u003ealso work with RCP target.\n\nI looked at the \u0027Creating an Eclipse plug-in\u0027, and nowhere in it do we tell you to reconfigure the target to an RCP target.\n\nThat wouldn\u0027t even make sense because the org.eclipse.ui.ide.workbench is not contributed by one of the RCP plug-ins.\n\nSo please point us to the part where you told to mess with the target.\n",
    "You\u0027re right, it\u0027s not recommended in the tutorial itself, but in several places such as Eclipse RCP book, and the RCP faq where you can read:\n\n\"With the default setup of the Eclipse SDK, plug-ins are developed against the same plug-in configuration used by the IDE itself. However, it is possible to configure the IDE to build, run and deploy against a different version of the eclipse base, via the Plug-in Development \u003e Target Platform preference page. Configuring the target platform is highly recommended in order to avoid introducing unwanted dependencies on IDE plug-ins into your RCP app.\"\nhttp://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/RCP_FAQ\n\nReading this, one might expect it\u0027s possible to run a plug-in on RCP target.",
    "what\u0027s recommended for one scenario (e.g. RCP) is not necessarily what\u0027s recommended for regular plug-in development.\n\nMike, to be on the safe side, can you please add a step to the \u0027Creating an Eclipse plug-in\u0027 cheatsheet to go to the Target Platform preference page to ensure you are pointing to the Eclipse install location and ALL plug-ins are checked.",
    "Fixed.\n\nWork Done:\n\n* Created new task \"Configure PDE\" in \"Create a plug-in\" cheatsheet\n\n  -\u003e Merged old task \"Open the plug-in development perspective\" into it\n  \n  -\u003e Linked help button to target platform doc in PDE Guide\n  \n  -\u003e Added command to open the target platform preference page\n     \n     - Encountered bug:  When the command is clicked, the target platform\n       preference page dialog is opened and the cheatsheet is loaded into\n       the system tray of it; but, the subitem task is not checked as \n       being completed.  Only when the \"OK\" button is selected on the dialog\n       and the cheatsheet returns to the cheatsheet view is the subitem task\n       checked as being completed.\n       \nSee attached Patch #1",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d46720)\nPatch #1\n\n",
    "Patch released.  Thanks Mike."
