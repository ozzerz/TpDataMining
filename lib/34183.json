    "In the RC2 version of Eclipse for OS X it isn\u0027t possible to change the layout of the \npackage explorer ( Flat / Hierachical ). The action seems to stay. To quit eclipse \nsubsequently sometimes produces an error message.\n\nWith the IB-Build of 20030227 it worked correctly.",
    "Can you attach the error message that happens when you quit?",
    "This seems to work fine for me. Could you provide more information, like which\nplugins we are browsing and exact steps to reproduce it.\n\nThanks!",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d3973)\nError Message while closing the eclipse ide\n\nthis is the output while closing the ide. But after restarting the Eclipse IDE,\nthe problem \nseems to be resolved. Now it\u0027s possible to switch between Flat / Hierarchical\nlayout. Could the problem be within the migration process of the old\nworkspace??\n",
    "Please could attach the log file that is in your workspace \n(e.g ./metadata/.log)?\n\nThanks!",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d4033)\nthe eclipse log file\n\nHere\u0027s the logfile. Because I copied the workspaces from version to version,\nonly the\nlast entries are the logs  of RC 2\n",
    "There are many exceptions in your log. I believe the one that is causing\nyour problem is:\n\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tree.getItems(Tree.java:532)\n\tat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.TreeItem.getItems(TreeItem.java:372)\n\tat org.eclipse.jface.viewers.TreeViewer.getChildren(TreeViewer.java:112)\n       ....\n\nThis problem is fixed in the latest (\u003e 20030310). I\u0027ll close this bug. Please\nreopen it if you can reproduce it in builds greater than 20030310.\n\nSilenio\n",
