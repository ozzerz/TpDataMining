    "Steps to reproduce:\n\n- Start RAC\n- Profile using IAC\n- There are two different error messages displayed as indicated by the attached snapshots.\nThe first error message indicates that there is no agent controller running.  Even though there is.  It indicates that the Agent Controller might not be installed or might not be configured to connect to your computer.  \nThis is obviously an incorrect error message.  UI should indicate that the RAC is currently running and the user should select \u0027localhost:10002\u0027 instead of \u0027Local Direct Connection\u0027.\n\nWhen user clicks on OK another error message is generated indicating that the launch delegate has failed.  This second error message is redundant and it should be removed.  This error seems to be caused by the following NPE:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\nnull\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.provisional.launcher.AbstractProcessLauncher.configureProcess(AbstractProcessLauncher.java:179)\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.internal.launcher.deleg.application.PIJavaLauncherDelegate.configureProcess(PIJavaLauncherDelegate.java:48)\n  at org.eclipse.tptp.trace.ui.provisional.launcher.PrimaryLaunchDelegate.run(PrimaryLaunchDelegate.java:302)\n  at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:797)",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d38546)\nError 1\n\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d38547)\nError 2\n\n",
    "The error message is fixed, there are also bug when an unknown host was selected. \nnow the error message are based on selection of RAC/IAC/remote host. Existing error message are modified and reused.\n\nfor the second part of the problem, it\u0027s a dup of bug 138496",
