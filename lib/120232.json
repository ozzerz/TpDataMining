    "Could you please provide a bit more detail on the steps to reproduce the problem?  Are you getting this error when going through the Web service client with any WSDL file?  Can this problem be reproduced everytime?  Is the WSDL file in the workspace or on a remote URL?\n\nThis is very likely a Linux specific problem.  The Web services smoke test (which tests creating bottom-up and top-down Web Services, creating Web services client and the Web Services Explorer) passes on Windows XP.  \n\nPeter M. had tested the Web services scenarios on RHEL 3 with last week\u0027s driver as well and they were OK.  We had not tested on SLES though.  \n\nWhich driver are you using?  Are you able to use the Web Services wizard to create bottom-up or top-down Web service (with or without checking the \"generate client proxy\" check box) using the same driver on SLES?",
    "I tried creating Web service (top-down and bottom-up) and Web service client with WTP1.0RC2 on both RHEL 4 and SLES 9.  I was able to run them successfully.  So, this could be a problem more specific to SLES 9.3.\n\nI was running my tests logged on as root.  Were you logged on as root when you encouter the problem?  If not, could you please retry your scenario logging on as root?",
    "Sorry.  I downloaded a stockquote wsdl from xmethods to my local workspace.  Right-clicked on it in the Package Explorer, select Web Services -\u003e Generate Client and the wizard comes up.  I set it up for Java Proxy (Tomcat 5.0 server) and proceed as far as the Web Service Proxy Page, click next and get the error.\n\nJust tried the same process as root and everything works ok.  So this is only a problem when running as a regular user.\n\nNot sure what you mean by: \"Which driver are you using?\"",
    "Also tried with a totally fresh workspace with my regular system user.  Same error appears using same process.",
    "Lowering severity since this is only a problem running on Linux for users who do not have root access.  The workaround is to log on as root.\n\nBy \"what driver are you using\", I mean which WTP driver were you using when you encoutered the problem.  Was it RC1 or RC2 that you got from:\n\nhttp://download.eclipse.org/webtools/downloads/\n\nIf it is driver you got somewhere else, could you specify the exact date and time of the build you were using?  I am trying to correlate the exact line that\u0027s failing with the correct version of code.\n\nCould you also check the workspace/.metadata/.plugins directory and see if the directory org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis.consumption.core exist or not?  The code is trying to create a temporary directory in that directory.  I\u0027m suspecting a normal user might not have authority to carry out that operation.",
    "BTW, I\u0027ve looked at the code in WSDL2JavaCommand.createTempDir, and it uses pretty platfrom neutral ways of getting the temp directory. \n\nJeffrey, do you have a pretty \"normal\" file system, where your plugins are installed? Oh, and do you have \"write\" permissions for the plugins metadata area? \nThat\u0027s in your workspace, in .metadata. I think you would have blown up before this if not, but ... just trying to cover the bases. \n\nPlus, Jeffrey, given definitions of severity: \nCritical: crashes, loss of data, severe memory leak\nMajor: major loss of function\n\nwould you agree this is \u0027major\u0027, not \u0027critical\u0027? \n",
    "Since there is a workaround (not a good one) I am ok with lowering severity to major.\n\nThis is occurring with WTP 1.0RC1 (not sure which site it was downloaded from, but it was a standard mirror drop site).  Was not aware that RC2 was out already, so I will check with this as well.\n\nThe directory org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis.consumption.core DOES NOT exist in my normal workspace.  It does exist in the root workspace I tested with.  My SLES install is pretty vanilla (this is a work laptop), and I see no reason why the directory would not be created.  All directories are owned and have permissions allowing my user to access/create/mod/execute where necessary.\n\nI will change to major.",
    "Hi Jeffrey, we tried the followng with a new workspace with RC1 logged on as a normal user (no root access):\n\n1. Create Tomcat 5.0 server and start it.\n2. New -\u003e Web Service -\u003e Web Service Client.  Select to test the Web service.  Click Next.\n3. On the Web service selection page, paste the following URL in the WSDL field:\nhttp://www.xmethods.net/sd/2001/TemperatureService.wsdl\n4. Click Next until the last page and click Finish.\n\nWe were able to go through the Web service client scenario successfully and run the Web service (mind you, that Web service just returns -999 for all zip code).\n\nWhen we check the workspace/.metadata/.plugins directory and the org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis.consumption.core was created.\n\nSo I\u0027m starting to suspect this is a problem more unique to your setup.  Could you please try logging on as the user you had problem running the scenario with and try to create a directory named org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis.consumption.core  in the workspace/.metadata/.plugins directory and if that is successful, try creating a directory in that directory?\n",
    "BTW, the createTempDir method in WSDL2JavaCommand had not changed between RC1 and RC2 or even RC3, so I doubt if a newer driver would help you.",
    "I still get the same result using your process.  I even created an \u0027org.eclipse.jst.ws.axis.consumption.core\u0027 directory in .metadata/.plugins and still get the error.  I will do some debugging of the plugin source code and report back on what I find.",
    "I figured out part of the problem:  my eclipse install was owned by root.  Once I did a chown -R myuser. eclipse-3.1.1, the wizard now works.  However, this does not answer the question of why it would require write/mod permissions on the base install (not just the workspace/.metadata) directories for a regular user.  I will keep investigating.",
    "Hi Jeffrey,\n\nAs your problem isolation determines that this is a problem with general user not having access to the Eclipse install location if it is installed with root access, this is not a specific Web services problem but a general Eclipse platform issue with accessing the install location for general Linux user.  I suspect the code is failing at the line:\n\nString pluginTempDir \u003d WebServiceAxisConsumptionCorePlugin.getInstance().getStateLocation().toString(); \n\nI think you should open a separate defect for that problem.  I\u0027m going to resolve this bug as invalid once you\u0027re OK with this.",
    "Well, it appears that I cannot reproduce the problem now - even after reverting back to root ownership of the eclipse install.  So I am willing to let this close as invalid.  If it occurs again and I can reproduce, I will submit to the eclipse core project.",
    "As we are trying to close down WTP 1.5, please get the latest WTP 1.5 driver to verify the bug and reopen if the problem had not been fixed.  If this defect is not verified/reopened by end of day 06/16, I\u0027ll attempt to verify the defect by reproducing the problem as described in the defect.  However, since you know your scenario best, it would be more appropriate if you verify the fix.",
    "This is part of a mass update to close out all stale WTP bugs which are in the resolved state without an appropriate targeted version.  If you feel this bug was closed inappropriately, please reopen."
