    "When a symptom catalog is open inside the SDB editor, and that symptom catalog is changed outside of the editor, the SDB editor needs to refresh.  The editor is not refreshing at the current time and this causes exceptions to occur in downstream consumers who add extensions to the editor.",
    "*** Bug 137048 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "I don\u0027t see this as a valid scenario. Please book a meeting to go over your usecase",
    "The current plan is to no longer modify the catalogs \"under the covers\" during analysis.  However, there will be a new menu item in the Log Navigator to convert XPath rules to another type of rule on a symptom catalog, and if the catalog is open in the editor when this menu item is selected, the editor will still need to refresh.\n\nMalcom Zung\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe editor should refresh the content, that is a standard editor behaviour. We\u0027ll keep the TPTP defect opened by you to address this problem.\nThanks,\n\nAlexandru Nan - Software Developer",

    "Alex, I\u0027m still seeing this problem with the 4.4 M5 driver.",
    "Can you please explain the failing scenario.",
    "1. Create a symptom catalog\n2. With the catalog open in the editor, use an external editor like notepad to make some changes to the .symptom file\n3. Refresh the Navigator view\n\nThe editor does not pick up the changes made outside Eclipse.",
    "Are you changing the resource outside the workbench? I tried to change the resource inside the workbench by using the wb text editor and it refreshes.",
    "Malcom, I did the following test: I changed the symptom catalog description outside Eclipse with a text editor, the I refreshed the resource navigator in Eclipse and switched to the sdb editor and observed the symptom catalog description changed accordingly. I am using my development workbench and an i1 driver though.",
    "I just tried the scenario described above with TPTP-4.4.0-200703220100 and IBM JDK 1.5 SR1 and the editor refreshes and displays the updated description. I\u0027m not sure what scenario you follow.",
