    "I have code where I call something like the following:\n\nIFile file \u003d ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().getFile(path);\n\nwhere path is something like \"c:/test.html\"\nWhen I do this, I end up with:\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Path must include project and resource\nname: /test.html\n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isLegal(Assert.java:62)\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Workspace.newResource(Workspace.java:1631)\n        at\norg.eclipse.core.internal.resources.Container.getFile(Container.java:123)\n\nI don\u0027t see anything in the javadoc that says I\u0027m not allowed to pass this path into the getFile() method.  (I realize the path I\u0027m passing in is not in the workspace, but that\u0027s part of the reason why I have to call getFile(). To see if the path I have is in the workspace or not)",
    "This part of the javadoc for IContainer#getFile(IPath) is what you are looking for\n\n* The supplied path may be absolute or relative; in either case, it is\n* interpreted as relative to this resource and is appended\n* to this container\u0027s full path to form the full path of the resultant resource.\n* A trailing separator is ignored. The path of the resulting resource must \n* have at least two segments.\n\nThe resource you are trying to create would have only one segment in the path, that\u0027s why the exception is thrown."
