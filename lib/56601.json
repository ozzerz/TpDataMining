    "Created an attachment (id\u003d10009)\npatch for org.eclipse.platform\n",
    "Jeff, the patch just restores old code (rev. 1.42) that ensures configArgs was\nbig enough (100), as it is being done on EclipseStarter as well.\n\nInternalPlatform in the other hand just returns, I guess it is because there is\nreally nothing else to be done. In EclipseStarter and Main, there is some code\nin the end of the method that should be run even if no args where passed.",
    "I applied the patch but in the end this hsould not be needed.  The root cause \nis bug 55393 which is forcing us to have a workaround.  The workaround is only \nneeded in certain cases involving PDE but is not a problem when running from \nEclipse.exe.  If you happen to run using java.exe and not spec any command line \nargs you are unhappy.\n\nLeaving open pending resolution of bug 55393.  The we will remove the \nworkaround and update the array creation to be more robust.",
    "The blocking part of bug 55393 has been fixed.  I updated Main and \nEclipseStarter to use args.length rather than a hardcoded 100.  The processing \nat the end of Main.processCommandLine() does not appear to do anything \ninteresting in the args.length \u003d\u003d 0 case.\n\nThe processing at the end of EclipseStarter.processCommandLine() is interesting \nso I just copied the two interesting lines up and put them inside an if \n(args.length \u003d\u003d 0) which then returns.\n"
