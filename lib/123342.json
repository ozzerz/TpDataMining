    "I replaced page breaks I had set in text elements with page breaks in the properties of header rows of the table.  This cures one of the PDF problems, but still I think it should render the same way in HTML and PDF.\n\nI tried to resolve the page break in the middle of the table, but could not fix it.  I put in avoid page breaks inside the table, but it didn\u0027t fix it.  I reset the page break interval to -1, and it still didn\u0027t work.\n\nI am posting revised report file and pdf results. ",
