    "JIRA query is not working in the last integration build. I am getting an error dialog \"query parameters do not match the repository configuration, please check the query properties\". That happens even on newly created queries, including those from the Codehaus repository.",
    "Did you try updating the repository configuration?",
    "(In reply to comment #1)\n\u003e Did you try updating the repository configuration?\n\nYes. I even tried to delete query AND repository and recreate them from scratch and got the same error.",
    "Steffen, apparently it is failing on creation of the JiraCustomQuery in the code you\u0027ve added on May 4th:\n\n...\n  } else if (validate) {\n    throw new InvalidJiraQueryException();\n  }\n...\n\norg.eclipse.mylar.internal.jira.ui.InvalidJiraQueryException\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.internal.jira.ui.JiraCustomQuery.createFilter(JiraCustomQuery.java:242)\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.internal.jira.ui.JiraCustomQuery.getFilterDefinition(JiraCustomQuery.java:118)\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.internal.jira.ui.JiraRepositoryConnector.performQuery(JiraRepositoryConnector.java:133)\n\tat org.eclipse.mylar.tasks.ui.SynchronizeQueryJob.run(SynchronizeQueryJob.java:110)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:55)\n",
    "The actual reason is that JIRA is using -1 status for \"all\" or \"any\" value of some attributes, so logic you\u0027ve added is not correct.\nI\u0027ve committed some code to make error message more informative, but won\u0027t be able to on the fix for the issue before late tonight.",
    "Yes, I made similar changes in the RSS parser code  to reveal some of the hidden errors in the Mylar code (previously dummy projects and components were created when the repository configuration was not up to date).\n\nI get the same error when I select a resolution. I\u0027ll investigate. \n\nAs a work around you can use the \u0027Any\u0027 resolution to get queries working.\n\n",
    "An id of -1 means Unresolved for resolutions. A test case and fix for JiraCustomQuery.createFilter() need to be added. I can look into this in a few hours. Eugene, just assign it to you if you want to fix it.",
    "I noticed that changes on this by Eugene went into HEAD, are these supposed to be in 2.0M3??",
    "(In reply to comment #7)\n\u003e I noticed that changes on this by Eugene went into HEAD, are these supposed to\n\u003e be in 2.0M3??\n\nThey better be. Though that change only add more info to the error and JIRA connector is still broken in the HEAD.\n",
    "Steffen: We need to cut the final 2.0M3 build asap.  I have these changes in and will merge them to 3.2, but need to know if/when to expect fixes to this so that I can schedule them, or whether to document this as a \"known limitation\".",
    "I could fix this now (it\u0027s just one line).",
    "Committed fix to CVS. Still need a test case for this.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d67160)\nmylar/context/zip\n\n",
    "Great that you got this in on time Steffen.",
    "Committed test case.",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d67162)\nmylar/context/zip\n\n"
