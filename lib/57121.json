    "Eclipse M8\nCDT 2.0.0.200404011349\n\nTest case:\n1. Open the Search dialog (Search-\u003eC/C++ ...)\n2. Enter some text into the Search String field.\n3. Uncheck all of the Search For checkboxes.\n4. Set the scope to be Workspace.\n5. Limit the search to All Occurrences.\n3. Click the Search button.\n\nResult:\nThe following error is displayed:\nAn internal error occurred during: \"Search for All Occurrences\"\n\nThe following is dumped to the .log file:\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.core.runtime 4 2 Apr 01, 2004 15:40:22.359\n!MESSAGE An internal error occurred during: \"Search for All Occurrences\".\n!STACK 0\njava.util.NoSuchElementException\n\tat java.util.LinkedList$ListItr.next(Unknown Source)\n\tat org.eclipse.cdt.internal.ui.search.CSearchQuery.run(Unknown Source)\n\tat\norg.eclipse.search2.internal.ui.InternalSearchUI$InternalSearchJob.run(InternalSearchUI.java:68)\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:62)\n\nExpected:\nCDT should handle this error case more gracefully.",

    "fixed\n\nIf no Search For is selected, no search is performed and 0 matches are reported.\n\n",
    "made the additional change that if no search for is selected then the search \nbutton is greyed out.  This makes the original fix redundant.",
    "Hi,\n\nI just verified this testcase and found that it does not give an error on \nsearch, but the Search button is not greyed out if no Search For box is \nchecked. So this bug should be reopened.\n\nPixy.",
    "Re-opening based on Pixy\u0027s comments - Andrew, can you have another look?",
    "PR was not targeted to any particular release. Changing target milestone to 2.1",
    "Fixed in head and 2.0 stream ... for the final time! ;)\n\n- BG"
