    "Build ID: I20070323-1616\n\nThis was found using the test plugin from:\nhttps://dev.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id\u003d160564\nto run repeated connection attempts to the agent\ncontroller.\n\nBoth problems described in this log appear to be fixed in\n4.4 except in one case:\n\nWhen I am running an workbench on windows XP and remotely\nconnection to an agent controller on linux (paradox-rh21as)\nI frequently get a connection exception at around 45 attempts. The exception is:\n\norg.eclipse.hyades.execution.core.DaemonConnectException\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl._connect(NodeImpl.java:225)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:360)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl.connect(NodeImpl.java:347)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tat zsessionfailuretest.actions.SampleAction$1.run(SampleAction.java:116)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tat org.eclipse.core.internal.jobs.Worker.run(Worker.java:58)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCaused by: org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.InactiveProcessException\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.internal.execution.local.control.ProcessImpl.getProcessId(ProcessImpl.java:497)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\tat org.eclipse.hyades.execution.local.NodeImpl._connect(NodeImpl.java:220)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t... 4 more\nFailed to connect 19\t\n\nand is repeated for each connection attempt from the\ntime it first occurs until all attempts are made.\nAfter the failure the ac needs to be restarted before\nthe test can be attempted again.\n\n\n\n\nMore information:\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. download the *first* test plugin in the log 160564\nand install to eclipse plugins, restart eclipse.\n2. A menu item ACDiag should be present, choose the\nSession Connect item from this and give the prompts the\nremote linux host and at least 50 iterations with the default 0 ms gap (see the other bug or included source\nfor more details about this driver)\n3. If no error by completion repeat the execution",
    "Hi Samson,\nI\u0027ve investigated the defect and it seems that the descibed use case is inconsistent.\nAfter each test iteration a separate jvm is launched (with HyadesTestingSession class) and isn\u0027t being deactivated.\nSo, after 50 test iteration 50 jvm are launched and active and framework stops to work due to resource constraints.\n\nTo perform connection testing the use case should be improved.\n\nIt seems this bug could be closed as \"INVALID\"",
    "Hi Alan. Is it possible to fix the test case so that the idle jvms are freed up to prevent running out of system resources?\n\nIn the meantime I agree with Igor that the use case requires some rework but I will leave this open and target it to the furure.\n",
    "Hi Bing. I have transferred my bugs to you for triage. Thanks."
