    "After talking to Eric this is a dup of a bug that he fixed this afternoon. It is related to the Progress View and its animation. As long as you have the Progress View restored, it will happen.\n\nI killed Eclipse, deleted my workbench.xml file and restarted and I\u0027m ok now. I will not restore my Progress View until tonight\u0027s build is done.\n\nI will dup this as soon as I find the other bug.\n",
