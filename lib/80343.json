    "Note that the only negative effects from a users point of view is the annoying\nrequester. Noise in PDE error log is a very minor issue.\n\nIs there a way to disable the error log requester? \n\nAfter the 10th time it appears, it gets a bit boring. \n\nIMHO, the only people that care about this error are those that are a well aware\nof the PDE error log.\n\nPerhaps some less annoying way to flag a fresh error in the PDE error log?\n\nIf I could only google the preferences in Eclipse :-)\n\n?yvind\n",
    "This problem is especially annoying when debugging e.g. inside C++ STL libraries.\n\n?yvind\n",
