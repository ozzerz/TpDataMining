    "Add some breakpoint in a Java project.\n\nAdd a NPE Breakpoint.  After the breakpoint is added, group breakpoints by \nproject.  The exception breakpoint will be grouped as part of the first java \nproject.\n\nIf the breakpoints are grouped by files, the breakpoint will show up as part of \nOthers (no file).  I expected the exception breakpoint to be shown in \"Others \n(no project)\" if the breakpoints are grouped by project since the breakpoint \ndoes not really belong to any project.  The project that this exception \nbreakpoint belongs to seem to be random.  (I think it\u0027s the first java project \nJDT can find.)\n\nI think the following problem is a side effect to the way how exception \nbreakpoints are linked to a project. But I will mention it here.\n\nI got two java projects.  The NPE breakpoint is some how linked to the first \nproject.  Then I run a java debug session from the second project.  This debug \nsession suspends at a NPE and printed out stack trace in the console. \n\nI close the first project (the one that the NPE breakpoint is linked to.)  \nClosing the project will cause the NPE breakpoint to be removed.  But clicking \nthe link from the console to add the exception breakpoint again resulted in the \nfollowing exception:\norg.eclipse.debug.core.DebugException: Resource /JSPs is not open.\n\tat org.eclipse.debug.core.model.Breakpoint.run(Breakpoint.java:337)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.core.breakpoints.JavaExceptionBreakpoint.\u003cinit\u003e\n(JavaExceptionBreakpoint.java:141)\n\tat org.eclipse.jdt.debug.core.JDIDebugModel.createExceptionBreakpoint\n(JDIDebugModel.java:430)\n\tat \norg.eclipse.jdt.internal.debug.ui.console.JavaExceptionHyperLink.linkActivated\n(JavaExceptionHyperLink.java:95)\n\tat org.eclipse.ui.console.TextConsoleViewer.mouseUp\n(TextConsoleViewer.java:500)",
    "It looks like we\u0027re inconsistent on which resource we associate with exception \nbreakpoints - sometimes it the workspace root, and sometimes its the project \nassociated with the IJavaType in the JavaModel. We should be consistent (and \nprobably associate with workspace root for exceptions in class libs).",
    "This problem has existed forever. A JRE/System library is shared by all \nprojects that reference it on its buildpath. However, the Java model \narbitrarily assigns a JRE to one project (the first one that references is?). \nThis problem will exist for any breakpointin a system library (not just \nexception breakpoints).  The breakpoint ends up being associated with the \nproject that the Java model assigns to it.",
    "The problem of breakpoint grouping is covered by bug 82867. The breakpoint \nwould ideally be shown with \"rt.jar\" when grouping by file.\n\nThe problem of creating a breakpoint associated with a JRE lib that is \nassociated with a closed project is fixed by associating breakpoints in \nexternal archives with the workspace root.\n\nChanges in:\n\n* BreakpointUtils - associated with workspace root instead of project\n* JavaExceptionHyperLink - use BreakpointUtils to determine resource\n* JavaStackTraceHyperlink - if the exception can\u0027t be found by source locator \n(due to closed project) search the workspace too",
