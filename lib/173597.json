    "Problems happens in the animated graph (e.g. Flow Diagram), which has say 6 activities on editor, and connected to each other in the most complicated way possible. Try using ctrl key to make multiple selections of connectors + activites and delete. Followed by performing an undo operation. This undo does not correctly undo the actions performed. Please rectify, with thanks.",
    "There is not enough information in this Bugzilla to investigate the issue.\n\nWe need one of:\n\nAn example demonstrating the issue.\nA failing JUnit test demonstrating the issue.\nA patch containing a fixes for the problem.\n",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d58744)\nScreenshots\n\nShows the diagram before delete, after delete and after undo.",
    "Ok to recreate the error:\n1. Create a new Flow Diagram (GEF Plugin Example)\n2. Clear the diagram\n3. Put 4 new activities on diagram\n4. Create connections between the 4 activities in the most complicated way you can where they are all inter-connected to each other\n5. Using the ctrl-key select 3 connectors and 2 activities\n6. Delete the 5 selected items at one go\n7. Select undo option\n\nYou can see that the undo action does not undo correctly, ie. does not undo to the state before deletion.\n\n8. Further undo and the steps are all reverted incorrectly and even resulted in error printed below.\n\nI have attached screenshots for your viewing. \n\nThank you.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 4 2007-02-12 10:09:55.229\n!MESSAGE Unhandled event loop exception\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.ui 4 0 2007-02-12 10:09:55.245\n!MESSAGE java.lang.NullPointerException\n!STACK 0\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\tat org.eclipse.draw2d.graph.Edge.\u003cinit\u003e(Edge.java:164)\n\tat org.eclipse.gef.examples.flow.parts.TransitionPart.contributeToGraph(TransitionPart.java:108)\n\tat org.eclipse.gef.examples.flow.parts.ActivityPart.contributeEdgesToGraph(ActivityPart.java:74)\n\tat org.eclipse.gef.examples.flow.parts.ActivityPart.contributeEdgesToGraph(ActivityPart.java:78)",

    "When you delete an Activity and one of its Transitions, the Transition will be deleted twice. If you undo the deletion, the Transition will be added twice. I think that\u0027s what\u0027s causing the error.\n\nMy patch (and it\u0027s my first, so be patient) forces each Activity to check whether a Transition added to an Activity is already one of the Activity\u0027s Transitions.
