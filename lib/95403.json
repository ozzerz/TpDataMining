    "It is strange that it stopped working.  Rafael, can you see if there are any \nobvious changes that went in to cause this?\n\nHaving said that, switching back and forth has not really been a scenario that \nis high on the list.  Most people want to have a shared install of all the \ndifferent plugins but then run one configuration for Windows, another for \nlinux gtk, etc.  For any given configuration they do not switch on a per run \nbasis.\n",
    "Note that \"used to work\" and \"supported\" are different things. As Jeff\nmentioned, the main scenario we want to support requires you to use separate\nconfiguration areas for every OS. So if you cleaned the configuration area\n(keeping only the config.ini file), and marked the install as read-only, this\nwould force the configuration area to be stored under a OS-specific location, so\nthere would be no risk of collision. Explicitly specifying distinct locations\nfor the configuration area should work as well. For instance:\n\n./eclipse -configuration linux-configuration\neclipse.exe -configuration windows-configuration\n\nAs per the problem you are seeing now, the symptoms seem to indicate that we are\nnot discarding the cached state of bundle resolution when the platform changes.\nDuring shutdown, we somehow save the correct settings, and next time we restart\ntheproblem does not happen. I will investigate.",
    "Morten, only now I noticed you started the failing session with -clean. That\nmakes failing even more strange. Do you always run with -clean?",
    "Morten, could you try the following:\n\n1) once it is running fine on one platform, switch the other platform and run\nfor the first time with (in addition to any options you are already using):\n\n-console -consolelog -noExit\n\n2) As soon as it fails, you should be left at the \"osgi\u003e\" prompt. Eclipse will\nnot exit. Now type:\n\nss\n\nPlease attach the full output since Eclipse was started to this PR. Thanks.",
    "osgi console is a neat tool :) anyways this is the logs. And yes I always always\nrun with -clean.\n\nI understand if this wont be fixed for 3.1. It is an annoyance to me its not a\nproduction issue for our customers.\n\nI can add that the \"eclipse.product\" listed in config.ini (and that is what the\nexception complains about) is not located in the normal plugins directory. its\nin an extension directory which is located inside the platform install and our\nlinks/teamworks.product file contains this:\n-----------------\nmmoeller@mmoeller:~/Dev/TeamWorks/TeamWorks/KeplerSM/deploy/ae-eclipse\u003e more\nlinks/teamworks.product\npath\u003dteamworks\n-----------------\nSo could it be some cache that translates the path from \u0027teamworks/\u0027 into an\nabsolute path on the platform which causes it to fail on another OS? I have no\nidea how this actually works so I\u0027m just making wild guesses here ;) And from\nthe exception that sounds fair. That would also be an issue if people used the\ninstall on a shared drive and they used a different share drive-letter for\ndifferent machines however I\u0027m guessing.\n\n\nIn any case, this is the console log output with the \u0027ss\u0027 command:\n-----------------\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-06-17 10:42:58.116\n!MESSAGE Application error\n!STACK 1\njava.lang.RuntimeException: No application id has been found.\n        at org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.PlatformActivator$1.run(PlatformAct\nivator.java:204)\n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.ja\nva:376)\n        at org.eclipse.core.runtime.adaptor.EclipseStarter.run(EclipseStarter.ja\nva:163)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(Unknown Source)\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Unknown Source)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.invokeFramework(Main.java:334)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.basicRun(Main.java:278)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.run(Main.java:973)\n        at org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main.main(Main.java:948)\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-06-17 10:42:58.194\n!MESSAGE Bundle update@plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources.linux_3.1.0.jar [41] w\nas not resolved.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-06-17 10:42:58.241\n!MESSAGE Bundle update@plugins/org.eclipse.update.core.linux_3.1.0.jar [43] was\nnot resolved.\n\n!ENTRY org.eclipse.osgi 2005-06-17 10:42:58.288\n!MESSAGE Bundle update@plugins/org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.1.0.jar [48] was\nnot resolved.\nss\n\n\nFramework is launched.\n\nid      State       Bundle\n0       ACTIVE      system.bundle_3.1.0\n1       ACTIVE      org.eclipse.core.runtime_3.1.0\n2       ACTIVE      org.eclipse.update.configurator_3.1.0\n3       RESOLVED    org.eclipse.tomcat_4.1.30.1\n4       RESOLVED    org.eclipse.jface.text_3.1.0\n5       RESOLVED    org.eclipse.draw2d_3.1.0\n7       RESOLVED    org.eclipse.help.appserver_3.1.0\n8       RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.filebuffers_3.1.0\n9       RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.editors_3.1.0\n10      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.jface_3.1.0\n11      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.workbench.texteditor_3.1.0\n12      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui_3.1.0\n13      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.forms_3.1.0\n14      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets_3.1.0\n15      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.update.core_3.1.0\n                    Fragments\u003d55\n16      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.gef_3.1.0\n17      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.platform_3.1.0\n18      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.osgi.util_3.1.0\n19      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.boot_3.1.0\n20      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.swt.win32.win32.x86_3.1.0\n                    Master\u003d46\n21      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.ide_3.1.0\n                    Fragments\u003d56\n23      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.update.scheduler_3.1.0\n24      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.help_3.1.0\n25      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.views_3.1.0\n26      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.browser_3.1.0\n27      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.help.ui_3.1.0\n28      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.search_3.1.0\n30      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.console_3.1.0\n31      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.resources.compatibility_3.1.0\n                    Master\u003d36\n32      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.workbench_3.1.0\n                    Fragments\u003d54\n33      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.intro_3.1.0\n34      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.presentations.r21_3.1.0\n35      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.platform.doc.user_3.1.0\n36      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.resources_3.1.0\n                    Fragments\u003d31, 53\n37      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.compare_3.1.0\n38      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.variables_3.1.0\n39      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.update.ui_3.1.0\n40      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.expressions_3.1.0\n41      INSTALLED   org.eclipse.core.resources.linux_3.1.0\n42      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.help.webapp_3.1.0\n43      INSTALLED   org.eclipse.update.core.linux_3.1.0\n44      RESOLVED    org.apache.lucene_1.4.3\n45      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.commands_3.1.0\n46      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.swt_3.1.0\n                    Fragments\u003d20\n47      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility_3.1.0\n48      INSTALLED   org.eclipse.swt.gtk.linux.x86_3.1.0\n49      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.osgi.services_3.1.0\n50      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.text_3.1.0\n51      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.help.base_3.1.0\n52      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.rcp_3.1.0\n53      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.core.resources.win32_3.1.0\n                    Master\u003d36\n54      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.workbench.compatibility_3.1.0\n                    Master\u003d32\n55      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.update.core.win32_3.1.0\n                    Master\u003d15\n56      RESOLVED    org.eclipse.ui.win32_3.1.0\n                    Master\u003d21\n\n\n\n",
    "The path you specify in the link file is relative to the Eclipse install or to\nyour current directory?",

    "I tested this a little more. It is not only a Linux -\u003e Windows issue, it is a \nchange folder issue.  \n \nScenario: \n \n1.

    "And actually, from the xml it seems like it is not an issue because I have a \nrelative path in my link file (that path is kept as file:teamworks/eclipse/), \nit is the path to the link file itself that is turned into an absolute path. \n \nSo any change to the folder (change drive, move folder etc) of an eclipse \ninstall that uses extensions will fail I would think. \n ",
    "Re: comment 11 - relative paths in the links files are resolved having the\n*current* directory as reference (not the install directory). This is not API,\nbut it is how it has been since a long time ago. I tested it myself, and later\nfound bug 35037 which is exactly about a request to make them install relative\ninstead.\n\nThe problem in your scenario is caused by recent work in storing site URLs\nrelative to the install URL. Now we always store them as relative URLs. Before,\neven sites whose URL where specified as relative by the user would be\nimmediately transformed to absolute and saved that way. If locations changed,\nduring the next startup the existing configured site would be discarded right\naway (the site location does not exist). But now we store them as relative, so\nwhen we read them back, they seem to exist fine.\n\nThe issue is that we do not store the link file location relative as well (bug\n98335). So after reading the already configured directories, we  process the\nlinks directory and ignore what we find there because the same site has already\nbeen configured.  The next step is what kills us: in\nPlatformConfiguration.validateSites(), any sites whose linked file locations do\nnot exist are discarded.\n\nThere are two possible fixes for this one: either bug 98335 is fixed (ideal\nsolution, but more risky) or in the ConfigurationParser, we discard configured\nsites if their link file location does not exist as well (for a matter of\nconsistency I think we should anyway).\n\nDorian, Dejan: do you want to even look at a patch?",
    "Created an attachment (id\u003d23633)\npatch for org.eclipse.update.configurator\n\nHere it is anyway. It does what I mentioned before. The validation done while\nparsing the configured sites applies the same rules as the validation done by\nPlatformConfiguration.validateSites().",
    "Note that due to the way Update deals with user specified relative URLs and\nrelative URLs coming from the persisted platform.xml this will only happen for\nthe case the external location path is specified as relative to a directory\nunder the install. Two workarounds are possible:\n- to have the relative external location outside the eclipse directory\n- to specify an equivalent path such as: ../eclipse/myproduct instead of just\nmyproduct.",
    "\"this will only happen for the case the external location path is specified as\nrelative to a directory under the install\"\n\nshould read: \n\n\"this will only happen for the case the relative external location path is a\ndirectory under the install\"\n\nThe two workarounds described above apply.",
    "Given the worksarounds from comment 16, can we just readme this?",
    "After reading all the comments, I am at loss as to what exactly is that we \nneed to put in the readme :-) (please forgive me, it has been a long release :-\n).",
    "I was thinking that we would just include the info from comment 16.  Perhaps \nRafael can help nail down some wording etc?",
    "Maybe too late, but here is the suggested blurb:\n\nExtension location is lost if the install path changes\n\nA previously configured extension location may be temporarily removed if the\ninstall is moved or mounted under a different path. This only happens when the\nlink file that configures the extension location uses a relative path that\npoints to a directory under the Eclipse install. On a second startup using the\nsame install path, the extension location is added again (bug 95403). ",
    "Just now noticed this was not in the update inbox. Dejan, please take a look at\nthe suggested note for the readme. Whether it should be released or not is up to\nyou.\n\nNote that even if the note released, this PR should still be fixed (after 3.1).",
