I prompts me following error:\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: \norg/aspectj/lang/NoAspectBoundException\nat Hello.main(Hello.java:6)\n\nAlso I tried the same steps with AspectJ1.5 and it also prompts me said Error.",
    "When running code built with AspectJ you must ensure the aspectjrt.jar is on\nyour classpath.  It can be found in your \u003caspectjInstallDir\u003e/lib folder.  This\njar contains the NoAspectBoundException class.",
    "*** Bug 92500 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***",
    "Is this resolved now?  Did you fix it by putting aspectjrt.jar on your classpath\nwhen executing the program?",
    "I\u0027m assuming the recommended solution fixed the problem. if not, please reopen."
