    "Build ID: M20070212-1330\n\nSteps To Reproduce:\nOn IE, set the following: \n  1) Tools -\u003e Internet Options -\u003e Privacy\n  2) Choose Advanced\n  3) Override cookies and block both 1st and 3rd party cookies\n\nLoad the SWT Browser somewhere. It doesn\u0027t seem to matter where, Eclipse 3.2/3.3, a home rolled one. \n\nGo to www.cnn.com and you get a nice stack overflow:\n\nJava version 1.6.0_01 from Sun Microsystems Inc.\nWindows XP v. 5.1 on x86\nFree/total memory: 9198392/29069312\n\njava.lang.StackOverflowError\nat org.eclipse.swt.internal.ole.win32.COMObject.callback6(COMObject.java:115)\nat org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.DispatchMessageW(Native Method)\nat org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS.DispatchMessage(OS.java:2265)\nat org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Display.readAndDispatch(Display.java:3291)\nat \n\n\nDetail: Uncaught thread error: swtbrowser-thread \n\n\nMore information:\nNot sure if this effects other browsers or OSs and seems to be very limited to cnn? for some reason. Any other site I have hit that requests cookies seems to behave just fine.\n\nWhen this does occur though, a popup is displayed stating: Stack overflow at line: 77 and completely freezes where ever the browser is running\n\nalso, this occurs on IE 6.",
    "I haven\u0027t been able to reproduce this with a few different OS/IE combinations.  Can you confirm that it happens for you with eclipse/swt 3.3 or newer, and with at least one of the following snippets:\n\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet128.java\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet173.java\nhttp://dev.eclipse.org/viewcvs/index.cgi/%7Echeckout%7E/org.eclipse.swt.snippets/src/org/eclipse/swt/snippets/Snippet270.java\n",
    "\nYes I have been able to reproduce it. I didn\u0027t see the stack overflow while running it under Eclipse3.3 but it did freeze the entire UI. All of the code snippets produced the error with the stack overflow message. \n\nI tried running the snippets with the swt jars from eclipse 3.3 and also from v3.3 here: http://www.eclipse.org/swt/\n\nI\u0027ll give the 3.4 build a try and see if it still produces the problem. Just for some more info out there, this is the current setup: \n\nWinXP Professional Version 2002 Service Pack 2\nPentium D 3.00GHz\nIE Version: 6.0.2900.2180\n\nI still have yet to see this happen on any other website besides cnn.com. Our beta went out on Friday that has the browser integrated and we have yet to see any bug reports on this issue. It\u0027s looking more likely that its a very isolated problem. ",
    "I just tried out the 3.4 build and am still seeing the same problems. Again to reproduce you need to set First Party cookies to Block. I just discovered that third party cookies don\u0027t seem to effect the problem. "
